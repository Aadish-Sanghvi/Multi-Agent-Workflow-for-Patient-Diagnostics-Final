Abstract
Objective

Chronic cough, a common outpatient symptom, has various aetiologies, including upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophagoeal reflux. The potential link between dental issues and respiratory diseases has recently garnered attention. This study aims to investigate the association between masticatory difficulty and chronic cough using data from the 2011–2015 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES).

Methods

Analysis included 9706 individuals from KNHANES. Participants self-reported masticatory function and chronic cough. Covariates included age, sex, underlying diseases, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, and laboratory markers. Binary logistic regression analysed odds ratios for chronic cough covariates. Multiple logistic regression assessed adjusted odds ratios for masticatory difficulty.

Results

Masticatory difficulty prevalence was 32.2%, with chronic cough higher in this group (4.8%) than in the group without masticatory difficulty (3.0%). After adjusting for socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, and laboratory markers, masticatory difficulty was significantly associated with greater chronic cough prevalence (odds ratio, 1.137; 95% confidence interval, 1.134–1.140).

Conclusions

Masticatory difficulty was linked with an elevated chronic cough risk in Korean healthy adults. Further research, including prospective studies and detailed investigations into gastroesophagoeal reflux disease and microbiological studies, is warranted to elucidate the impact of mastication on respiratory health. As masticatory difficulty may serve as a clinical indicator for chronic cough interdisciplinary collaboration between dental and respiratory health professionals can facilitate early intervention and enhance patient care.

Key words: Masticatory difficulty, Chronic cough, Respiratory health, Oral health

Introduction

Cough is one of the most common symptoms in outpatient care, with approximately 30 million patients in the US visiting the hospital each year.1 In the department of respiratory medicine, evaluating and managing persistent cough was reported to account for up to 40% of the total work.2 Cough can be classified based on its duration; thus, cough that has been present longer than 3 weeks is either subacute (3 to 8 weeks) or chronic (more than 8 weeks).1

The most common aetiologies of chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophagoeal reflux.3,4 However, other important causes must also be considered in patients with persistent cough. For example, a cough following viral or bacterial respiratory tract infection could persist for more than 8 weeks after the acute infection.5 Furthermore, dental problems have been reported to be associated with respiratory problems, including aspiration pneumonia and chronic cough.6,7

Mastication serves several functions, including breaking down large food particles, facilitating the action of digestive enzymes, and lubricating food particles to aid gastrointestinal absorption. Furthermore, the masticatory apparatus has various physiologic functions, including respiration, speech, blood circulation, and saliva excretion.8

Masticatory function is important in an ageing society, as masticatory disorders are prevalent amongst elderly individuals. Masticatory function in the elderly population is affected by factors such as the number of remaining teeth,9 the number of occlusal supports, occlusal force, salivary flow rate, and periodontal status.10 Furthermore, masticatory function is related to general health,11,12 including physiologic and psychological health.13

Recently, many studies have researched the association between oral hygiene and lower respiratory tract infections, such as community acquired pneumonia, ventilator associate with pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia.14,15 Furthermore, oral functions, including swallowing, mastication, and saliva secretion, have been known to influence oral hygiene.14 However, no studies have researched whether the chewing function is associated with the risk of respiratory symptoms, especially chronic cough, in community or epidemiologic settings. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine whether difficulty in mastication is associated with chronic cough.

Methods
Study population

The present study was performed using data obtained from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) from 2011 to 2015. KNHANES has been regularly conducted through a rolling sampling design for a stratified, complex, multistage, probability cluster survey by the Division of Chronic Disease Surveillance of the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 1998.

From the 2011–2015 KNHANES survey population, 19,378 participants aged 20 years or older were recruited for this study. The following criteria were grounds for exclusion: age younger than 20 years; incomplete answers about social and medical histories; and unmeasured data on blood pressure, weight, height, waist circumference, and laboratory markers. Finally, 9706 participants remained for analysis. The framework of the study is illustrated in Figure 1. All participants provided written informed consent to participate in this survey, and the data were anonymised.

Framework of the study.

This study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and received approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (IRB Nos. 2011-02CON-06-C, 2012-01EXP-01-2C, 2013-07CON-03-4C, 2013-12EXP-03-5C).

Sociodemographic features and lifestyle

The 24-hour recall method was used to gather medical history and nutritional status, including dietary information. Indicators of socioeconomic status, such as education and income, were collected. In KNHANES, education was assessed through questionnaires asking about the highest level of education completed, and this information was classified into 4 educational categories: completion of elementary school, middle school, high school, and university. Household income was calculated as the total monthly household income divided by the square root of the total number of household members, yielding 4 quartile groups.

Chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidaemia were screened for, and information about whether or not treatment was being received was also collected. Data on diseases related to chronic cough, such as asthma and tuberculosis, were also gathered. Regular exercise was indicated as “yes” when the participant exercised for more than 20 minutes at a time and more than 3 times per week, and the smoking group was defined as currently smoking.

Measurement

Height was measured in centimeters using a wall-mounted measuring scale, and weight in kilograms using a calibrated electronic scale, with participants wearing light clothing and no shoes. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as follows: weight (kg)/height2 (m2). Waist circumference was measured at the end of a normal expiration, with the participant in a supine position, and at the midpoint between the lower rib and the iliac crest.

Blood samples were collected via venipuncture after 10 to 12 hours of fasting. Serum glucose was measured using a Hitachi automatic analyser 7600 (Hitachi). Complete blood cell analysis, including white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), and haemoglobin (Hb), was collected in EDTA tubes (Standard Plus & Medical Co., Ltd.). These samples were immediately refrigerated, transported to the Central Testing Institute in Seoul, Korea, and analysed within 24 hours.

Definition of mastication function

The comprehensive oral health assessment was performed using questionnaires that included questions about oral health behaviour, chewing difficulty, speaking difficulty, and frequency of dental office visits in the past year. Trained dentists carried out oral examinations to assess oral status, gum inflammation, number of cavities, and the need for dentures.

Masticatory function was evaluated via questionnaire asking “Do you have difficulty chewing?” and a group with mastication difficulty was composed of participants who answered “yes” on the self-reported questionnaires; 9706 individuals were classified into 2 groups: those with normal masticatory function and those with difficulty in mastication.

Definition of chronic cough

The group with chronic cough was composed of participants who answered “yes” to self-reported questionnaires asking “Have you ever had a cough almost every day for more than 3 months per year?”1 Participants were classified into 2 groups: those without chronic cough and those with chronic cough.

Statistical analyses

Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS ver. 21.0; IBM Corp.). To calculate the total population the sample would represent, we employed the stratification variables and sampling weights designated by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test verified the assumption of normality (P < .05) for all continuous variables. Continuous variables such as age, blood pressure, waist circumference, and laboratory markers were analysed using Student T test. For categorical variables such as sex, chronic disease, and social demographics, the Chi-square test was used to compare frequencies and ratio between groups. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine odds ratios of covariates for chronic cough. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the adjusted odds ratios of mastication difficulty and chronic cough. P values of <.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Participant characteristics

Demographic and baseline characteristics in Table 1 were classified into 2 groups according to masticatory function, and the information in Table 1 was extracted from unweighted samples. The prevalence of masticatory difficulty was 32.2% (3121/9706), and chronic cough was more prevalent in the masticatory difficulty group (4.8%) than in the group without masticatory difficulty (3.0%).

The average age of the participants was older in the group with masticatory difficulty, and the group with masticatory difficulty comprised a higher proportion of men compared to the group without masticatory difficulty. Prevalence of chronic disease such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidaemia was greater in the group with masticatory difficulty. The prevalence of asthma was greater in the group with masticatory difficulty; however, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of tuberculosis.

Participants in rural areas exhibited more masticatory difficulty than those in cities, and a lower education level was associated with having masticatory difficulty. The masticatory difficulty group exercised less regularly and comprised a higher proportion of current smokers (Table 1). Furthermore, anthropometric and laboratory measurements including higher systolic blood pressure, higher waist circumference, and elevated WBC counts were observed in the group with masticatory difficulty.

Prevalence of chronic cough according to difficulty of mastication

In univariate logistic regression analyses, older age, male sex, living in rural areas, and lower educational levels were associated with a higher prevalence of chronic cough. Furthermore, dyslipidaemia medication, asthma, and tuberculosis were associated with a higher prevalence of chronic cough (Table 2). Lifestyle factors, including current smoking and lack of regular exercise, were also associated with a higher incidence of chronic cough.

Compared to the group with normal mastication, individuals with masticatory difficulty exhibited a significantly higher risk of chronic cough, as indicated by crude odds ratios. After adjusting for confounding factors, including age, sex, residential area, educational status, dyslipidaemia medication, asthma, tuberculosis, current smoking status, regular exercise, blood pressure, waist circumference, body mass index, WBC counts, and fasting glucose levels, masticatory difficulty remained significantly associated with a higher prevalence of chronic cough (Table 3).

Discussion

This research demonstrated that masticatory difficulty is independently associated with a higher risk of chronic cough, even after adjusting for covariates and population weighting. Previous studies have revealed that swallowing and masticatory disorders are associated with aspiration pneumonia.16,17 Furthermore, it was reported that the mis-swallowing habit was associated with the risk of chronic bronchitis in about 200 Swedish patients.18 Most of these studies were conducted amongst a sample of patients with moderate to severe symptoms of masticatory difficulty.

Figure 2 illustrates several potential hypotheses regarding the link between chronic cough and masticatory difficulty. Masticatory difficulty may influence the circulation of saliva. Recent data showed that during abnormal chewing, saliva was not well distributed around the mouth and has a tendency to stay on the mouth.19 Well-circulated saliva could aid in oral hygiene and pathogen clearance, whilst congested saliva serves as a reservoir for pathogens. Salivary enzymes may modify oral mucosa and play a significant role in microbial homeostasis; they may also have an antimicrobial function and promote adhesion and colonisation of pathogens20 through mechanisms including the modification of the mucosal epithelium due to a number of proteolytic bacteria and their enzymes, such as mannosidase, fucosidase, hexosaminidase, and sialidase; reduction of surface fibronectin by hydrolytic enzymes; and release of cytokines.20

Potential hypothesis of the link between the chronic cough and masticatory difficulty.

Masticatory disorders might lead to the swallowing of larger particles, inducing mechanical abrasion of the oesophagus, dyspepsia, vomiting, and aspiration.21 Furthermore, recent studies have shown that masticatory disorders are associated with swallowing larger particles, which could be linked to metabolic diseases such as obesity.22 Reflux of food, gastric acid, and normal gastrointestinal flora could irritate the nasopharyngeal apparatus, and this irritation is a major cause of chronic cough.

The masticatory function may influence dietary behaviour. Kato et al23 reported in 2010 that participants with well-functioning mastication ate vegetables and fiber more frequently. These results suggest the mastication function is related to individual nutritional status and immunity. Furthermore, reports have asserted that more functional mastication is associated with beneficial lifestyles such as regular sleep, regular physical activity, and smoking abstinance.24

During mastication, growth of papillae on the tongue was minimised. Masticatory processes abrade papillae of the posterior region of the tongue and clean debris from the tongue.15 These processes can reduce dental plaque colonisation with respiratory pathogens on the tongue; thus, masticatory difficulty may be associated with the presence of respiratory symptoms and aspiration pneumonia.15

This study is the largest and first epidemiologic study in Korea to suggest that poor mastication function is a risk factor for chronic cough. Our research included about 10,000 participants, representing—after weighting—10 million individuals, thereby reflectively and objectively representing the Korean population. Similarly, selection bias has been overcome through use of a validated and randomised selection method.

The study has several limitations. First, because the present study was cross-sectional and based on self-report questionnaires rather than a longitudinal study, a causal relationship between mastication and chronic cough could not be definitively established. Therefore, further well-designed longitudinal studies are required to determine the causality between chewing difficulty and chronic cough. Second, because information on chewing difficulties and chronic cough was acquired via a self-reported questionnaire, recall and social desirability bias may have affected the answers. Specifically, it is possible that masticatory function can be underestimated when using a subjective evaluation tool. Although this study was based on a self-reported questionnaire, subjective chewing problems are an important factor in the quality of dentition itself, as Gordon et al25 have claimed. Third, there was a slight difference between our operational definition of chronic cough (>3 months) and the commonly used definition (>8 weeks).1 However, a period of 3 months or more belongs to the category of 8 weeks or more, and the dataset that we analysed only had information about a 3-month period. Fourth, one important confounder—history of gastroesophageal reflux disease—could not be considered because there were no data for that. Instead, we analysed risk factors for gastroesophageal reflux disease such as body mass index and smoking. Finally, blood pressure medications that can cause coughing were not included in the study survey. Although some blood pressure medications can cause chronic cough, and checking for this would strengthen the study, we could not analyse this factor due to a lack of specific medication data. However, the univariate analysis showed no difference between the 2 groups regarding the history of hypertension.

In conclusion, masticatory difficulty was associated with greater risk of chronic cough in healthy Korean adults. Masticatory difficulty can be associated with various conditions including lack of teeth, improper dental prosthesis, neuromuscular dysfunction, and hyposalivation. Further analysis using oral examination to determine the cause of the association between masticatory difficulty and chronic cough should be performed.

Abstract
Background

When patients continue to experience cough despite conventional treatment, East Asian traditional medicine (EATM) including herbal medicine and/or acupuncture has been frequently used. Previous systematic reviews of EATM treatment for chronic cough have been conducted mainly on herbal medicine, targeting patients with conditions that cause cough. In clinical practice, EATM interventions are not limited to herbal medicine, and considering that chronic cough is often caused by two or more conditions or unspecific causes, a comprehensive investigation is clinically relevant. We examined the current research status of EATM for chronic cough.

Based on Arksey and O’Malley’s scoping review methodological framework, a total of six English, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese electronic databases were searched on August 2022. Any clinical studies on EATM targeting chronic cough patients (regardless of their cause) were included.

Results

Among 474 included studies, the study designs were mainly randomized controlled trials (72.4%), and the population was evenly distributed between children and adults. The cause of cough was not reported in most studies (56.1%). The common cause of cough was upper airway cough syndrome and post-respiratory infection (9.5%, each), followed by mixed cause (7.6%), nonspecific cause (5.9%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (4.0%). EATM was conducted for a mean of 19.1 days, and herbal medicine was the most common (80.6%). Conventional medication was frequently used as a control (81.2%). For outcomes, the total effective rate was the most frequently utilized (94.3%), followed by cough severity (53.8%). EATM treatment showed positive outcomes in most studies.

Conclusions

In future EATM studies, it is necessary to either specify the cause of chronic cough or to report that the study was targeting nonspecific chronic cough. In addition, high-quality studies assessing the efficacy of EATM with placebo control treatment should be conducted, using validated evaluation tools.

Introduction

Chronic cough is defined as a cough lasting more than eight weeks in adults and more than four weeks in children younger than 15 years [1, 2]. Currently, the prevalence of chronic cough is high, exceeding 10% of the total population, and 14–23% of adult non-smokers have chronic cough [3]. As chronic cough is ubiquitous, especially in the elderly population, the disease burden of chronic cough is expected to increase with a rapid population-aging trend, resulting in a significant socioeconomic burden [4]. In severe cases of cough, complications such as nausea, chest pain, urinary incontinence, and depression may arise [5]. In addition, patients with chronic cough reported poor health-related quality of life, impairment of work productivity and activity, and utilization of more healthcare resources [6]. Typical causes of chronic cough include upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma including cough variant asthma (CVA), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [7]. However, more than one condition may be involved at a time. There are also a significant number of patients with nonspecific chronic cough (with no identifiable cause after a reasonable evaluation, including history taking, physical examination, radiography, and spirometry), and unexplained chronic cough (idiopathic or refractory; with an unknown etiology that persists after a comprehensive investigation, medical assessment, and appropriate therapeutic trials) [8–11].

The conventional treatment of chronic cough involves the administration of medications to treat the cause of the cough, and empirical treatment with antitussives, expectorants, or mucolytics is provided when it is difficult to accurately test or differentiate. However, 10–40% of patients with chronic cough who visit advanced medical institutions are not treated appropriately despite the best diagnostic tests and treatment efforts [12]. In addition, the effect is limited in more than 70% of patients with chronic cough, which may be mainly attributed to the insignificant effect of conventional treatments and equivocal diagnostic methods [13]. Therefore, an effective alternative treatment approach that can be applied even when the cause is unclear or when the cough is resistant to conventional treatments is required. In this situation, East Asian traditional medicine (EATM) treatment including herbal medicine and/or acupuncture has long been used for cough [14, 15]. However, despite its utilization [14, 15], clinical evidence has not been sufficiently accumulated, raising concerns about its effectiveness and safety [16]. Previous systematic reviews of EATM treatment for chronic cough have been conducted mainly on herbal medicine treatment, targeting patients with conditions that cause cough, such as UACS and CVA [17–19]. However, no attempt has been made to comprehensively investigate clinical studies of EATM interventions besides herbal medicine for chronic cough, regardless of its cause. In clinical practice, because EATM interventions are not limited to herbal medicine, and considering that chronic cough is often caused by two or more conditions or unspecific causes, a comprehensive investigation is clinically relevant.

A scoping review summarizes the scope and number of available literature articles and examines the nature and content of the research evidence, aiming to quickly map the main concepts, primary sources of information, and types of available evidence supporting the research area [20]. It does not describe individual research results in detail. It is conducted to investigate the scope of the literature of a specific area, identify the populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICOs), and investigate the potential subject range [21]. Therefore, we used a scoping review methodology to examine the current clinical research status of various EATM treatments for chronic cough regardless of its cause by analyzing study designs, populations, EATM treatments, and outcome measures used in existing clinical studies and proposed appropriate PICOs for future systematic reviews of EATM.

Methods

We conducted the study according to the following 5-step scoping review protocol based on the Arksey and O’Malley framework [20, 22]: 1) Identifying the research question, 2) Identifying relevant studies, 3) Study screening and selection, 4) Data extraction, and 5) Collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. This study was described according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews Checklist and Explanation [23], and the study protocol was registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) registry prior to the study (URL: https://osf.io/7w3q4).

Identifying the research question

As described in the Introduction section, the purpose of this scoping review was to evaluate the status of clinical studies of various EATM treatments for chronic cough regardless of its cause. Therefore, the research question in this scoping review was as follows: “How much clinical research on EATM treatments has been conducted for chronic cough, and which study designs (i.e., case report, case series, non-randomized controlled clinical trial [CCT], and randomized controlled clinical trial [RCT]), population (i.e., the cause of cough and age [children and adults]), EATM treatment (herbal medicine, acupuncture, combination treatment, etc.), and outcome measures were used?”

Identifying relevant studies
1) Information sources

The following six databases were searched on August 21, 2022, by one researcher (BL): three English databases (Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), one Chinese database (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), one Korean database (Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System), and one Japanese database (CiNii). All retrieved studies from each database from their inception dates to the search date were reviewed. To identify potentially missing literature, the reference lists of studies included in the scoping review were also screened. The database search strategy combined chronic cough corresponding to the population and EATM treatment corresponding to the intervention. The search terms were a combination of index words and free words and were finalized after discussions with specialists in respiratory medicine (K.I.K. and B.J.L.) and systematic review methodology (C.Y.K.). Detailed search strategies and the results for each database are presented in S1 Appendix.

2) Eligibility criteria

(1) Populations: Studies targeting patients with chronic cough (i.e., cough lasting more than eight weeks in adults aged ≥ 15 years and four weeks in children aged < 15 years [1, 2]) regardless of sex, age, race, and the cause of cough were included. However, studies targeting patients with comorbid diseases other than chronic cough or studies that did not specify the duration of cough were excluded.

(2) Interventions/comparators: For therapeutic interventions, treatments based on EATM including herbal medicine, acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping therapy, chuna, pharmacopuncture, and a combination of them were included. As this review focused on herbal compositions formulated according to EATM, studies of single herbs were excluded. In cases where EATM treatment and conventional treatment were used together as medical interventions in controlled studies, only studies using the same conventional treatment as the control intervention were included. There were no other limitations on the comparators. If treatments were based on the EATM theory, no restrictions were placed on the country of publication.

(3) Outcomes: There were no restrictions on outcome variables.

(4) Study designs: Original human subject clinical studies such as RCTs, CCTs, retrospective cohort studies, before-after studies, case series, and case reports were included. Study protocols, review articles, and non-clinical studies were excluded.

(5) Others: There were no restrictions on language, publication year, and publication type such as journal articles, theses, and conference proceedings. However, we excluded preprints under review.

Study screening and selection

The study screening and selection process were performed using EndNote 20 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) for studies retrieved from database searches and other data sources. First, after removing duplicate entries using the duplicate literature removal function of EndNote 20, eligible studies were included after title and abstract review based on the eligibility criteria. Then, the full texts of eligible literature articles were obtained, and reviewed for final inclusion in the literature sources. Two researchers (B.L. and C.Y.K.) conducted the study screening and selection independently, and in cases of disagreement, an agreement was reached through discussion between the same two researchers.

Data extraction

Data extraction was independently performed by four researchers (B.L., C.Y.K., Y.J.K., and J.H.K.) using pilot-tested Excel forms, and discrepancies were resolved through discussions amongst themselves. The data extraction form was pilot-tested by two authors (B.L. and C.Y.K.) who independently extracted items from three included studies, which was developed into a comprehensive form that included all necessary but missing items.

From the final included studies, the following information was extracted using a pilot-tested Excel form: year of publication, study design, number of patients/participants included, country and language of publication, study setting, study population (children/adults, causes of chronic cough), types of EATM treatment (such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, and moxibustion), control group intervention (in the case of controlled studies), treatment period, outcome measures, and results. We classified the study designs of included studies according to the design algorithm for studies of interventions and exposures [24]. For outcome measures, the following indicators were extracted: (1) Cough severity assessed by scales such as cough symptom score (CSS), visual analog scale (VAS), and traditional Chinese medicine symptom score; (2) cough frequency; (3) cough-related quality of life assessed by scales such as the Leicester cough questionnaire (LCQ) and cough-specific quality-of-life questionnaire (CQLQ); (4) total effective rate (TER); (5) blood biomarkers such as eosinophil counts and C-reactive protein; (6) pulmonary function test indices such as forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity; and (7) adverse events. As this scoping review was conducted to provide an overview of existing studies in this field, the results reported in individual studies were out of scope and were not extracted. Instead, we extracted and classified the effect of EATM on each outcome measure in individual studies as “Positive outcomes”, “Not different from a control” (applies only to controlled studies), and “Inconsistent” (inconsistent results among assessment tools that evaluate the same outcome measure [e.g., in cough severity assessment, EATM showed positive outcomes with VAS but not CSS]). Adverse events were extracted only to determine whether they were reported in the included studies.

Collating, summarizing, and reporting the results

Descriptive analysis was performed on the extracted data, and the results are expressed as the frequency and ratio for categorical variables and the mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables. As the scoping review did not evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies and minimized data synthesis, the results of the current analysis are presented using figures and tables through a descriptive and quantitative summary. All statistical analyses were performed using Excel 2019 (Microsoft Office, Redmond, WA, USA).

Results
Study selection and study characteristics

A total of 2929 articles were searched from the databases. After removing 244 duplicate articles, the titles and abstracts of 2685 articles were screened, and 2002 articles were excluded. Subsequently, 682 studies for which full-texts could be confirmed were reviewed, and 208 studies were excluded for the following reasons: not about chronic cough (n = 95), no information on cough duration (n = 62), accompanied by other diseases not related to cough (n = 11), not only for EATM (n = 8), review articles (n = 26), duplicate (n = 2), and only abstracts available without data (n = 4) (S2 Appendix). Finally, a total of 474 articles were included (Fig 1 and S3 Appendix). In terms of publication year, the number of included studies increased sharply after 2012. In terms of study designs, before 2011, the proportion of observational studies including case series, case reports, and retrospective cohort studies was similar to that of interventional studies including RCTs and CCTs; however, after 2012, the number of interventional studies was markedly augmented (Fig 2).

In terms of study designs, 343 (72.4%) RCTs accounted for a majority of studies. There were 51 (10.8%) CCTs, 18 (3.8%) before-after studies, five (1.1%) retrospective cohort studies, 47 (9.9%) case series, and 10 (2.1%) case reports (Table 1). The number of study subjects per study was 94.6 ± 75.4 (mean ± SD) (range, 1~663). The number of subjects according to the study design was 99.1 ± 75.3 (range, 24~663) for RCTs, 85.6 ± 34.3 (range, 36~200) for CCTs, 99.5 ± 73.8 (range, 30~300) for before-after studies, 92.0 ± 32.0 (range, 60~124) for retrospective cohort studies, 91.8 ± 88.9 (range, 30~450) for case series, and 1.3 ± 0.7 (range, 1~3) for case reports.

In terms of country of publication, 473 (99.8%) studies were published in China, and only one (0.2%) RCT was published in South Korea. In terms of publication language, 472 (99.6%) articles were published in Chinese, and the remaining two (0.4%) articles were published in English. In terms of study settings, 471 (99.4%) studies were conducted in hospitals or clinics. Only one (0.2%) study was conducted in a public health center, and two (0.4%) studies did not report the study setting (Table 1).

Demographic characteristics of the study populations

Among the studies describing the cause of cough, UACS (45 studies, 9.5%), post-respiratory infection (45 studies, 9.5%), mixed cause (studies involving patients with more than one cause of cough, such as both UACS and CVA) (36 studies, 7.6%), and nonspecific (28 studies, 5.9%) were the most frequently reported. Most studies (266 studies, 56.1%) did not state the cause of chronic cough (Table 1). Analysis according to the age of the study population revealed that post-respiratory infection (37 studies, 21.5%) was most frequent in studies involving children, followed by UACS (29 studies, 16.9%) and mixed cause (13 studies, 7.6%), excluding studies that did not report the cause of cough. However, in studies involving adults, mixed cause (17 studies, 7.4%) was the most ordinary, followed by nonspecific (15 studies, 6.5%) and GERD (13 studies, 5.6%). In the case of cough due to UACS and post-respiratory infection, more than 50% of studies involved children. On the other hand, in the case of CVA, GERD, chronic bronchitis, eosinophilic bronchitis, nonspecific chronic cough, and unexplained chronic cough, more than 50% of the studies involved adults (S4 Appendix).

EATM treatment

Among the EATM treatments used in the included studies, herbal medicine alone was used in most of the studies (382 studies, 80.6%). Acupoint herbal patching (AHP) (19 studies, 4.0%), AHP plus herbal medicine (16 studies, 3.4%), manual acupuncture (nine studies, 1.9%), and moxibustion (six studies, 1.3%) were also frequently used (Fig 3). The current status of EATM clinical studies according to the cause of cough in children and adults is presented in Figs 4(A) and 4(B). After excluding 10 studies that did not report the treatment period and 41 studies that indicated only the range, the average EATM treatment period in the remaining 423 studies was 19.1 ± 13.6 days (range, 3~90 days). There were 399 studies with control groups (343 RCTs, 51 CCTs, and five retrospective cohort studies). Conventional medication alone was used in most controlled studies (324 studies, 81.2%), and herbal medicine was also used frequently in 49 (12.3%) studies. The number of studies using sham acupuncture and placebo drug was one each (0.3%).

Outcome measures and results

Most studies (447 studies, 94.3%) reported the TER based on cough symptoms, followed by cough severity in 255 (53.8%) studies, adverse events in 164 (34.6%) studies, blood biomarkers in 58 (12.2%) studies, cough-related quality of life in 52 (11.0%) studies, pulmonary function test indices in 31 (6.5%) studies, and cough frequency in nine (1.9%) studies.

The results were divided into three categories (“Positive outcomes”, “Not different from a control”, and “Inconsistent”). Based on the results of cough severity, cough frequency, cough-related quality of life, TER, and blood biomarkers, more than 90% of studies determined that EATM treatment showed positive outcomes for chronic cough. Based on pulmonary function test indices, EATM treatment was statistically significant in 87.1% of the studies, and 9.7% of the studies showed no significant difference when compared with a control group (Table 2).

Discussion

Through a comprehensive study search, a total of 474 clinical studies were included. A review of the general characteristics of the included studies revealed that a number of relevant studies were conducted in the past 10 years (2012~2022), and interventional studies showed an increasing trend. These results might imply that the current trends have shifted to evaluation of evidence-based efficacy/effectiveness of specific EATM interventions rather than observational studies on its use and impact, due to the growing need for alternative treatments for chronic cough. Most studies did not report the cause of chronic cough. All of these studies were conducted in China, published in Chinese, and only described patients with chronic cough. In addition, no information revealed the cause of cough, including causative conditions and specific/nonspecific coughs. In conventional medicine, treatment strategies differ depending on the cause of cough. Although EATM has its own diagnosis system and a pattern identification questionnaire for chronic cough [25], it is necessary to consider not only the pattern but also the cause of cough to determine the appropriate therapeutic approach. Therefore, in future studies, in the case of a specific cough, the cause should be stated, and in the case of a nonspecific cough, this should be indicated clearly. Additionally, to inform more readers around the world of the clinical effects of EATM, future related clinical studies should be published in international journals in English.

Among the EATM treatments, herbal medicine alone was the most often utilized, but EATM combination therapy was also frequently used, which may be attributed to the use of various EATM treatment combinations in clinical settings. EATM treatment showed positive outcomes with the main outcome measures. In controlled studies, conventional medication was mostly used as the control, and EATM treatment was significantly more effective than the control, showing no difference from the control in less than 10% of the studies. In particular, herbal medicine is characterized as involving multiple components and multiple targets [26]. Therefore, unlike conventional medication, which is used for treatment according to the cause, herbal medicine is promising not only for cough with a cause but also for cough whose cause is not specified or cannot be explained. In general, there are many causes of chronic cough, and it is a condition that can appear as a symptom with a combination of various causes [27]. It is not easy to identify the main cause of cough [5]; thus, empirical treatment is performed [28, 29]. In this case, herbal medicine having multi-components multi-targets characteristics might be helpful. Accordingly, studies evaluating the effect of EATM treatment on nonspecific or unexplained chronic cough should be conducted in the future. For this purpose, according to the definition of nonspecific or unexplained chronic cough [10, 11], history taking, physical examination, radiography, and spirometry should be performed to determine the cause of cough, and patients whose cause is unknown or who do not improve after appropriate therapeutic trials should be recruited. In addition, nonpharmacological interventions such as AHP, manual acupuncture, and moxibustion were also frequently used in the included studies. Due to the nature of nonpharmacological therapy, it is a safe treatment if performed by an experienced practitioner [30, 31], and its clinical effectiveness and safety for cough have been reported in previous studies [32–34].

As most of the studies were conducted in China, the TER based on chronic cough symptoms was described in most of the included Chinese studies, and a significant number of studies declared only TER results without other indicators. To the best of our knowledge, a core outcome set for chronic cough has not been developed; however, several clinical practice guidelines have recommended the use of standardized cough assessment tools [35–37]. In addition, a cough-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire is considered to be the most comprehensive evaluation of the impact of cough on patients, and its use in cough-related clinical studies has been recommended [35, 37]. Therefore, to objectively and accurately assess the effect of EATM treatment, standardized and objective evaluation tools such as the CQLQ, LCQ, and Chronic Cough Impact Questionnaire (CCIQ) should be used in future clinical studies [38–40]. In addition, the features of EATM, such as pattern identification, should be reflected when assessing the effect of EATM treatment, and it is necessary to develop a core outcome set for chronic cough.

Based on the findings, we proposed the PICOs for a systematic review of EATM treatment of chronic cough as follows. First, for the population, various studies have been conducted on post-respiratory infection and UACS in children and on nonspecific chronic cough and GERD in adults. Therefore, it will be possible to analyze the effect size of EATM on chronic cough associated with these causes in children and adults. If an inclusive population is selected for patients with chronic cough broadly, it is necessary to analyze subgroups according to age (children and adults) and diseases that cause cough. Second, for the type of intervention in systematic reviews, the effects of herbal medicine or acupuncture-related therapy (acupuncture, moxibustion, and AHP) on chronic cough regardless of its cause can be summarized. Third, for the comparators, conventional medication is usually used as a control group and there are limited studies using a placebo control (sham acupuncture and placebo drug). Therefore, clinical questions that evaluate efficacy by setting the comparator only as a placebo control are not appropriate. Fourth, for outcome measures, they can be established by referring to the frequently reported outcome measures identified in this review (cough severity, cough-related quality of life, and TER), and outcomes recommended in clinical practice guidelines [35–37].

This study has some limitations. We established the search strategy including free words and index words corresponding to “chronic cough” and did not include search terms such as UACS, CVA, and GERD corresponding to the cause of cough. Therefore, there might be related studies that have not been analyzed in this review. In addition, to achieve the purpose of the scoping review, which rapidly maps the range and number of available studies, we attempted to present comprehensive evidence by conducting searches using various databases with increased accuracy.

Nevertheless, this is the first study to examine the clinical research status of EATM treatment for chronic cough using a comprehensive and rigorous methodology. We attempted to minimize reporting bias by registering the research protocol in a registry, and through mapping (a key element of scoping reviews), the scope of the study could be visualized and confirmed at a glance. Based on the findings, systematic reviews that summarize the effect size and safety of various EATM treatments and evaluate the methodological quality of individual studies and the quality of evidence for the combined effect estimate should be conducted, which may aid the clinical decision-making of clinicians, patients, and researchers. In the future, relevant clinical studies should be conducted not only in China but also in countries such as Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. Furthermore, clinical studies should be conducted on the cause of cough and EATM treatment, which lacked clinical evidence as identified in this review.

Clinical research on EATM for chronic cough illustrated that the cause of cough was not presented in most studies, and the most common cause was upper airway cough syndrome and post-respiratory infection. Herbal medicine alone was the most utilized treatment, and conventional medication was frequently used as a control. For outcomes, TER and cough severity were often assessed. In future EATM studies, it is necessary to specify the cause of chronic cough or to state that the study was targeting nonspecific chronic cough. In addition, high-quality studies assessing the efficacy of EATM with placebo control should be conducted, using validated evaluation tools.

Abstract
Background

Chronic cough has been associated with reduced health-related quality of life, negative impacts on sleep, work, and other daily activities, and increased use of health care resources. Little is known about the prevalence of chronic cough in Italy. In the present study we sought to estimate the prevalence of chronic cough in Italy, describe sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with chronic cough, and characterize the impact of chronic cough on overall health and wellness, work and other daily activities, and health care resource use.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study to collect sociodemographic and health-related data from Italian residents who participated in the 2020 National Health and Wellness Survey (N = 10,026). To assess the characteristics and burden of chronic cough, adults who indicated that they had experienced chronic cough during the prior 12 months were compared with propensity score-matched controls without chronic cough.

Results

The estimated weighted lifetime and 12-month prevalence of chronic cough were estimated as 9.2% and 6.3%, respectively. Compared with matched controls, respondents with chronic cough had significantly lower measures of overall physical and mental health (P < .001 for both comparisons), and significantly higher rates of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders (P < .001 for all comparisons). Chronic cough was significantly associated with higher rates of impairment of work and other activities (P < .001 for all comparisons) in the past 7 days, any-cause emergency department visits and hospitalizations in the prior 6 months (P < .001 for both comparisons), and more visits to general and specialist health care providers (P < .001 for both comparisons) in the prior 6 months.

Conclusions

In Italy, chronic cough affects an estimated 3.3 million adults annually and represents a significant burden to individuals and the health care system.

Keywords: Chronic cough, Cough, Chronic disease, Italy, Health surveys

Background

Globally, approximately 10% of adults have chronic cough [1], a protracted and debilitating condition, in which over 40% of affected adults report living with this condition for ≥ 5 years [2, 3]. A 2015 meta-analysis of global studies found that the burden of chronic cough is highest in North America and Europe, the latter having an estimated prevalence of 12.7% [1]. Factors associated with chronic cough in clinic- and population-based studies from Europe include smoking, female sex, and, to a lesser extent, older age [4–10]. However, the findings of clinic-based studies may not be generalizable due to differences in cough severity and health utilization patterns. Furthermore, population-based studies from Europe do not use a consistent definition of chronic cough, and prevalence estimates for individual European countries are frequently limited in number [1, 11]. Current estimates of chronic cough prevalence in Italy are based on studies with limited sample sizes primarily conducted during the 1980s and 1990s [4, 5, 12].

In the current study, we sought to address this knowledge gap by using a nationally representative survey to estimate the 12-month and lifetime prevalence of chronic cough among Italian adults. We further sought to describe the sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, and health care utilization patterns associated with chronic cough in Italy.

Methods
Study design

An analysis of chronic cough in Italy was carried out using data from the National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS). The NHWS is an international, self-administered, internet-based health survey conducted annually in Italy, other countries in Europe and Asia, and the United States. The data reported here were derived from the 2020 fielding of the NHWS, which was administered to an age- and sex-representative sample of adults in Italy from December 2019 through March 2020. The prevalence of chronic cough was estimated in a cross-sectional analysis; factors associated with chronic cough were identified in a matched case-control analysis. All study respondents underwent informed consent, and respondent information was fully anonymized. The study (protocol, 19-KANT-205) received an exempt status upon evaluation by the Pearl Institutional Review Board.

Study sample

Respondents to the NHWS were recruited via an existing general-purpose, voluntary, web-based survey. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years at the time of the survey, literacy in Italian, and the ability to provide informed consent; there were no specific exclusion criteria. Respondents were stratified based on their history of chronic cough: those who indicated that they had ever experienced chronic cough (defined as daily cough for ≥ 8 weeks, in alignment with clinical guidelines [13–15]) were included in calculations of lifetime prevalence, whereas those who indicated experiencing chronic cough in the past 12 months were included in calculations of 12-month prevalence. Respondents who did not experience chronic cough in the past 12 months were retained as a control group for propensity score-matched comparisons.

Study measures

Study measures have been detailed elsewhere [16]. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short Form Survey v2 (SF-12v2; Quality Metric, Lincoln, RI [17]) and the EuroQol 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5 L™; EuroQol Research Foundation) [18]. Three summary measures derived from the SF-12v2 were used in the NHWS: the physical and mental health components of the SF-12v2 (calculated using a mean score of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10) and the SF-6D, a preference-based health utility index. For all three measures, higher scores represent better health. The composite index score was reported for the EQ-5D descriptive system, with 0 representing death and 1 the best possible health state. The EQ-5D also includes a vertical visual analogue scale (VAS), asking respondents to indicate on a number line their self-rated health for that day with 0 representing the “worst imaginable health state” and 100 representing the “best imaginable health state”. The General Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) was used to assess anxiety [19], and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression [20]. Both the GAD-7 and the PHQ-9 measure symptom frequency during the prior 2 weeks using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Total scores for the GAD-7 range from 0 to 21, with values 15 and above indicating severe anxiety symptoms. Total scores for the PHQ-9 range from 0 to 27, with values 20 and above indicating severe depression.

Health-related impairment of work and activity during the past 7 days was measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) [21]. The 6-item WPAI measures four impairment outcomes: the percentage of work time missed due to health (absenteeism), the percentage of working hours impaired due to health (presenteeism), total work productivity loss due to health (productivity impairment), and the percentage of non-work activity impairment due to health (activity impairment). All respondents provided data for activity impairment; only respondents who reported being employed provided data on work-related impairments.

Difficulty sleeping was evaluated with yes or no questions regarding whether the respondent regularly experienced the following: difficulty falling asleep, waking during the night and not being able to get back to sleep, waking up several times during the night, waking up earlier than desired, sleep apnea, poor quality of sleep, daytime sleepiness, or difficulty staying awake.

All-cause health care resource use was measured as the number of hospitalizations and visits to health care practitioners (general or family clinicians, specialists, or emergency department [ED] clinicians) made in the past 6 months.

Data analysis

The prevalence of chronic cough was calculated using unweighted estimates, as well as weighted estimates adjusted for the age and sex distribution of the Italian population. The unweighted estimates of lifetime and 12-month prevalence of chronic cough were calculated using the total number of NHWS respondents as the denominator. The weighted prevalence estimates were generated by applying Horvitz-Thompson sampling weights calculated using the age and sex distributions reported for Italy in the 2019–2020 International Data Base of the United States Census Bureau [22].

Comparisons were conducted between adults with chronic cough and matched controls without chronic cough using propensity score matching. Adults who experienced chronic cough within the past 12 months were compared with a propensity score-matched sample of adults without chronic cough from the general population (i.e., those who did not experience chronic cough within the past 12 months) using a 1:3 matching ratio. Logistic regression modeling was used to estimate propensity scores. Explanatory variables included in the logistic model were age, sex, marital status, household income, an interaction term for marital status x household income, and a modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) that excluded chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as this condition is commonly associated with chronic cough. The variables were selected for matching based on clinical importance/interest or those deemed to be potential confounders to account for differences in health care and general health status between adults of different sexes, age, and socioeconomic status and comorbid conditions not associated with chronic cough. Data were reported as means and SD for continuous variables, and frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables. Statistical comparisons were conducted using chi-square tests and t-tests, as appropriate. Two-tailed P values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Prevalence of chronic cough in Italy

Among all the 10,026 NHWS survey respondents, 905 (9.0%) reported experiencing chronic cough during their lifetime and 619 (6.2%) respondents reported experiencing chronic cough during the previous 12 months (Table 1). The weighted analysis resulted in similar findings, with the lifetime and 12-month prevalence rates of chronic cough in Italy’s adult population estimated to be 9.2% and 6.3% or 4.8 million and 3.3 million adults, respectively.

a  The prevalence of chronic cough was calculated using unweighted estimates, as well as weighted estimates adjusted for the age and sex distribution of the Italian population. The unweighted estimates of lifetime and 12-month prevalence of chronic cough were calculated using the total number of NHWS respondents as the denominator. The weighted prevalence estimates were generated by applying Horvitz-Thompson sampling weights calculated using the age and sex distributions reported for Italy in the 2019–2020 International Data Base of the United States Census Bureau [22]

b The weighted P values cannot be estimated due to the empty cell in the ‘Other’ category

In the weighted analysis, the lifetime prevalence of chronic cough was higher among females compared with males (10.3% vs. 7.9%; P < .001; Table 1) and among respondents with a history of smoking compared with those who had never smoked (11.2% vs. 6.5%; P < .001). Regional differences in the lifetime prevalence of chronic cough were also observed (P < .001), with a higher prevalence in southern Italy (11.8%) than in central (8.9%) and northern (7.6%) Italy. Trends in the 12-month prevalence of chronic cough were similar to those of lifetime prevalence. The 12-month prevalence of chronic cough was higher in females compared with males (7.5% vs. 4.9%; P < .001) and in former or current smokers compared with never smokers (7.9% vs. 4.1%; P < .001). Unweighted lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates were similar to weighted estimates, varying by less than 0.4% in 90% of strata.

Sociodemographic characteristics of respondents with chronic cough

A total of 614 respondents with chronic cough were matched (five of the 619 respondents with chronic cough were not matched; four respondents had only two matches and another three respondents had only one match). Thus, the total number of matched controls without chronic cough is 1,832.

In the propensity score-matched analysis, respondents with chronic cough differed from matched controls by level of education (P = .026) and region of residence (P < .001; Supplementary Table 1). As expected, due to the matching, there is no significant difference between respondents with chronic cough compared with propensity score - matched controls in distributions of age, sex, household income and marital status; employment status and type of insurance also did not significantly differ between respondents with chronic cough and propensity score-matched controls.

Health and health-related quality of life impacts of chronic cough

Respondents with chronic cough during the past 12 months reported poorer health-related quality of life compared with propensity score-matched controls without chronic cough, as shown by lower mean values of the physical (47.22 vs. 50.19) and mental (40.68 vs. 44.83) component summary scores of the SF-12v2 and the SF-6D utility score (0.63 vs. 0.68; P < .001 for all comparisons; Table 2). Further, EQ-5D scores were lower, indicating a worse health state, for those with chronic cough compared to those without (0.83 vs. 0.88; P < .001) and VAS (65.70 vs. 73.72; P < .001). Compared with propensity score-matched controls without chronic cough, respondents with chronic cough more frequently reported digestive (38.8% vs. 23.7%), respiratory (64.2% vs. 24.8%), and sleep (31.3% vs. 14.4%) conditions during the past 12 months (P < .001 for all comparisons).

Health care resource use burden of chronic cough

In total, 94.1% of respondents with chronic cough reported the use of health care provider services for any reason during the prior 6 months compared with 87.0% of propensity score-matched controls (P < .001; Table 3). On average, respondents with chronic cough had two more visits with any health care provider during the prior 6 months than did the matched controls (7.84 vs. 5.46; P < .001). Compared with propensity score-matched controls, respondents with chronic cough more frequently reported hospitalization (12.5% vs. 7.4%), the use of ED care (23.0% vs. 12.9%), the use of specialist care provided by general or family practitioners (75.9% vs. 69.8%; P < .004), and visits to allergists (11.4% vs. 4.9%), cardiologists (20.5% vs. 13.6%), gastroenterologists (9.6% vs. 5.6%), geriatricians (1.6% vs. 0.2%), otolaryngologists (7.2% vs. 3.8%), and pulmonologists (9.3% vs. 2.0%; P < .001 for all comparisons except general or family practitioners P = .004). Significant differences between groups in the use of services provided by internists, neurologists, psychiatrists, or psychologists/therapists were not observed.

Discussion

There is a lack of data describing chronic cough and its impact in Italy and the present study contributes to this knowledge gap. In summary, we found that Italian adults have an appreciable burden of chronic cough, corresponding to an estimated weighted lifetime and 12-month prevalences of 9.2% and 6.3%, respectively. The prevalence of chronic cough was highest among females, current and former smokers, and residents of southern Italy. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, marital status, household income, and a modified CCI, chronic cough was associated with residence in southern Italy and having less than a high school education. Notably, chronic cough was associated with significantly increased health care utilization, work and activity impairment, and poorer health outcomes, including more comorbidities, lower physical and mental health status, anxiety, and depression.

Information on the prevalence chronic cough in Italy is limited, however, our estimated prevalences (9.2% [lifetime]/6.3% [12-month]) are similar to those reported by authors using the same definition of chronic cough and comparable survey-based methods as the current study; including Denmark (3.8% 12-month) [8], France (7.5% [lifetime]/4.8% [12-month]) [23], Germany (6.5% [lifetime]/4.9% [12-month]) [24], Spain (8.2% [lifetime]/5.5% [12-month]) [25], the United Kingdom (6.2% [lifetime]/4.9% [12-month]) [26], and the United States (5.0% 12-month) [16]. In contrast, the prevalence of chronic cough in Italy was estimated to be in the range of 10–15% in a 2015 meta-analysis [1]. However, the three Italian studies included in the meta-analysis were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s and defined chronic cough as a cough lasting ≥ 3 months during the past two years [4, 5, 12]. In the current study we defined chronic cough as a daily cough ≥ 8 weeks duration, the definition which has been utilized in clinical guidelines [13–15]. Differences in the definition of chronic cough are unlikely to fully explain the lower prevalence of chronic cough reported in our study as studies using a threshold of 8 weeks to define chronic cough typically report higher prevalences than those using a threshold of 3 months [11]. It is possible that the burden of chronic cough among Italian adults, though still considerable, may have decreased from the 1980s and 1990s. This may be partially explained by changing demographics and cultural practices. For instance, smoking, an established risk factor for chronic cough [27], has decreased in Italy with male smoking prevalence decreasing from 41.6% in 1986 to 29.5% in 2009 [28] and female smoking prevalence decreasing from 19.2% in 1986 to 17.0% in 1993 [28].

We evaluated age- and sex-related differences in chronic cough, finding a significantly higher prevalence of chronic cough among females and a numerical trend of increasing prevalence of cough in the prior 12 months with older age. These findings align with those of European and North American studies of cough clinics, which report a preponderance of older women [29]. Our findings also align with those of most [5–8], but not all population-based studies from Europe [30], showing higher chronic cough prevalence with increasing age. In contrast, many [4, 6, 8, 30], but not all [7], population surveys from Europe report either no sex-related differences in chronic cough prevalence or a higher rate in males [5]. Mixed findings regarding sex-related trends in chronic cough may reflect sampling differences between clinic- and population-based studies, as well as complex epidemiology. Biological differences, including higher levels of estrogen and progesterone, may render women more susceptible to chronic cough, while cough risk factors, including smoking and occupational exposures, are higher among men than women in some settings [29].

In a propensity score-matched analysis controlling for age, sex, marital status, household income, and comorbidities, we found that chronic cough was associated with a lower education level. Several population-based studies support this finding, reporting an approximate 50% increase in the risk of chronic cough among individuals with a low compared with a high socioeconomic or educational level [4, 8, 9, 27]. Our propensity score-matched analysis also found a significantly higher prevalence of chronic cough among individuals residing in southern compared with central or northern Italy. Although evidence is scant regarding subnational differences in the burden of chronic cough, three studies from Italy have evaluated this issue. One study found sub-regional differences in the prevalence of chronic cough in Italy’s Po River valley [12]. Two other studies reported higher prevalences of asthma and respiratory symptoms in southern compared with central or northern Italy, which in quantitative analyses were primarily attributable to climatic factors [31, 32].

Our findings showed that Italian adults with chronic cough had an excess burden of comorbidities, including anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. These findings accord with those of population-based surveys from Europe, including a multi-country survey in which over 90% of adults with chronic cough reported feeling depressed due to their cough [33]. The findings of these European surveys highlight ways in which chronic cough may undermine mental health by disrupting social interactions and engendering frustration over inadequate treatment for cough despite high health care utilization [33, 34].

We observed substantially greater health care utilization among Italian adults with chronic cough compared with adults without cough, including nearly twice the rate of ED visits and hospitalizations. Results of a 2020 fielding of the NHWS conducted in the United States similarly reported that adults with chronic cough visited the ED about twice as often as those without chronic cough [16]. Notably, the costs associated with respiratory disease are not limited to greater health care utilization, but also encompass impaired work productivity, particularly among individuals with severe symptoms. Indeed, we observed a striking burden of impaired work productivity associated with chronic cough in the previous 12 months, equating to over 40% of work hours. Recent studies from Asia, Europe, and the United States report a similar degree of work productivity impairment of 26-43% for adults with chronic cough [16, 23, 25, 26, 35, 36].

The current study has limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. The data reported here are derived from the 2020 fielding of the NHWS, which was administered during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As data on the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus continues to unfold, and its effects on the prevalence and characteristics of chronic cough are not yet known [37, 38]. Therefore, the prevalence of chronic cough reported here may differ from the prevalence of chronic cough in Italy before, during, or after phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recall bias and self-presentation bias may have affected study results, as data on study outcomes were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. However, survey questions and response options were phrased to minimize these biases. For example, where possible, questions referred to recent timeframes to enable more accurate recall. Potentially sensitive questions included uninformative response options, such as ‘Don’t Know’ and ‘Refuse to Answer’ that allowed respondents to opt out. Further, the confidential nature of this survey may also have limited self-presentation bias. We conducted an adjusted analysis by propensity matching on age, sex, household income, marital status, and comorbidities; however, residual confounding by other factors may have affected the results. Although we enrolled a nationally representative sample of Italian adults, study findings may not be generalizable to subgroups excluded from the study, including institutionalized individuals or those who have severe disabilities, or limited internet access. In addition, the structure of the study population was skewed toward younger adults, and individuals > 75 years were under-represented. The study’s cross-sectional design limits the use of its findings for making causal inferences regarding chronic cough.

Conclusions

This study revealed a substantial burden of chronic cough among Italian adults. This burden included an estimated 12-month weighted prevalence of 6.3%, equivalent to over 3.3 million affected individuals, and an estimated weighted lifetime prevalence of 9.2%, equivalent to over 4.8 million affected individuals. This burden also manifested in greater rates of depression, anxiety, work impairment, and health care utilization among adults with chronic cough compared with their unaffected counterparts. Further research is warranted into the causes underlying the greater prevalence of chronic cough among women, individuals with lower education, and residents of southern Italy.

Abstract
Background

Chronic cough is common, negatively affects quality of life and has limited treatment options. Inhibition of purinergic signalling is a promising therapeutic approach but is associated with taste-related adverse effects. Little is known about treatment preferences from the perspective of patients with chronic cough, such as trade-offs between efficacy and side effect.

Methods

Patients with chronic cough completed an online discrete choice experiment survey in which they answered a series of questions requiring a choice between two constructed treatment options characterised by varying attribute levels. Selection of cough and taste-related attributes was informed by qualitative interviews and clinical trial data. Logit-based models were used to analyse resulting choice data.

Results

The discrete choice experiment survey was completed by 472 participants with chronic cough. Among study attributes, frequency of intense cough attacks was the most important to participants, followed by taste change, frequency of night-time coughing and frequency of daytime coughing. To accept the least preferred taste disturbance of a bitter, metallic, chalky or oily taste change, participants required either: (1) elimination of night-time cough along with a slight reduction in daytime cough; (2) elimination of daytime cough along with a pronounced reduction in night-time or (3) reduction in intense cough attacks from 7 to 2 times per week. Two distinct preference patterns were identified, each placing different importance on efficacy versus side effect trade-offs.

Conclusions

Participants with chronic cough were willing to accept some taste disturbances in exchange for improved efficacy of chronic cough treatments. Knowledge of patient preferences can facilitate shared decision-making.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Chronic cough is a common health problem that negatively affects quality of life. Emerging treatments for chronic cough are associated with taste disturbances, but the extent to which patients are willing to tolerate such side effects in exchange for cough relief is unknown.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS

Adults with chronic cough are generally willing to accept taste disturbances in exchange for improvement in chronic cough symptoms, particularly if the frequency of intense cough attacks is reduced.

HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY

Knowledge of the relative importance of cough-related attributes and potential treatment side effects from a patient perspective can support decision-making from the clinical and regulatory perspective.

Chronic cough is a common health problem that affects 5%–10% of adults worldwide and negatively impacts quality of life.1 Defined in adults as a cough that persists 8 weeks or longer, chronic cough is associated with sleep disturbance, fatigue, decreased work producitivty, anxiety, depression and increased healthcare utilisation.2 Chronic cough is commonly associated with comorbidities such as asthma, postnasal drip or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and in some patients, treatment of the comorbid condition can improve the cough.3 However, a considerable proportion of individuals have persistent cough despite a thorough evaluation and optimal treatment of comorbid conditions according to best practice guidelines, termed refractory or unexplained chronic cough.4 Recent insights into mechanisms of chronic cough has led to the development of drugs targeting neuronal hypersensitivity.5 Specifically, inhibition of afferent nerve excitability through ATP-dependent P2X3 receptor blockade has been identiifed as a promising therapeutic approach.6

Recent phase 3 clinical trials COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 evaluated P2X3 receptor antagonist gefapixant in adults with refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough and demonstrated significant reduction in 24-hour cough frequency and improvement in cough-specific quality of life in patients treated with gefapixant 45 mg two times per day.7 8 However, taste-related adverse events were common, occurring in about 59%–69% of patients receiving gefapixant 45 mg two times per day.7 The most common taste-related adverse event was dysgeusia, often described as a metallic, bitter or salty taste. Other taste-related adverse events included ageusia (loss of taste sensitivity), hypogeusia (defined as diminished taste) and hypergeusia (increased taste sensitivity). Notably, unpleasant taste-related side effects have been observed in most P2X3 receptor antagonists in development.9 Despite the possible trade-offs between cough suppression and taste-related side effects, the extent to which patients are willing to tolerate such side effects in exchange for improvement in cough, and which cough-related aspects would be prioritised, is unknown.

Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) can quantify patients’ health preferences and their willingness to accept trade-offs among different health and treatment-related attributes. DCE respondents complete several choice questions in which they choose between treatment profiles which involve trade-offs among outcomes such as safety, efficiacy and convenience. Quantification of patient preferences is an effective expression of the patients’ voice, which has been prioritised by both clinical and regulatory agencies.10

This study leveraged a DCE in adults with chronic cough to understand preferences for outcomes relevant to chronic cough treatments. Selection of cough-related outcomes was informed by qualtitative interviews with adults with chronic cough in order to identify meaningful attributes that impacted preferences. The DCE survey measured the relative importance of potential treatment benefits and side effects and quantified patients’ willingness to accept risks of taste alteration side effects in exchange for improvements in chronic cough symptoms. An exploratory analysis evaluated how preferences vary across patients with chronic cough.

Methods
DCE development and patient involvement

DCE development was informed by the literature review of both chronic cough and taste disturbance, physician input and one-on-one qualitative interviews conducted with 20 adults diagnosed with chronic cough according to the American College of Chest Physicians’ guidelines.11 12 The literature review specifically focused on how adults with chronic cough define cough severity, using attributes such as frequency, intensity and timing of cough, as well as the impact of chronic cough on daily activities. With regard to taste disturbance, the literature review focused on how adults with dysgeusia or ageusia described their experiences. Taste-related attributes also were informed by recent clinical trial data (NCT02612610). Physicians involved in the care of patients with chronic cough provided input regarding aspects of chronic cough symptoms, diagnosis and management that were used to inform the design of qualitative interviews. The one-on-one qualitative interviews elicited patients’ experiences with chronic cough to identify chronic cough characteristics or attributes important to patients (Coles et al13 in press).14 The interviews also included bidding games and a card-sort activity to assess the importance of key chronic cough and treatment features. The final DCE attributes and levels were thus based directly on patient involvement.

Table 1 describes the final DCE attributes and levels. Cough-related attributes included cough frequency (0, 5, 10 or 20 times per hour), cough timing (daytime vs night-time) and number of intense cough attacks (0, 1, 3 or 7 times per week). Intense cough attacks were defined as a series of repeated violent coughs that last between 30 s and 2 min and can make it hard to breathe. Taste alteration was selected as the primary treatment side effect, with the following attribute levels: normal taste, inability to taste sweet foods, inability to taste salty foods, or a metallic, chalky or oily taste.

*Denotes the reference condition in the study design.

To obtain trade-off data, the survey instructed respondents to assume they were coughing 20 times per hour both during the night and during the day and having 7 intense cough attacks per week. This represented the reference condition, in which respondents were not experiencing any taste changes. The DCE survey consisted of 10 versions of 12 choice questions that were generated using the SAS system15 to produce required statistical information to identify all attribute levels. Respondents were assigned to 1 of the 10 versions randomly. In each choice question, respondents were asked to choose between two constructed treatment options characterised by varying attribute levels from the reference condition. An example choice question is shown in figure 1.

Example choice question.

DCE respondents’ cough attributes at the time when his/her cough was at its worst were assessed using a five-level categorical scale. The questions were derived from the Cough Severity Diary, a patient-reported outcome measure with validity evidence in chronic cough.16 To test the draft DCE survey instrument, pretest interviews were conducted with patients with chronic cough, which are further detailed in online supplemental file 1. Several data quality checks were included in this study, which are detailed in online supplemental file 1.

Recruitment

For qualitative interviews and survey pretest interviews, adults diagnosed with chronic cough at Duke University who could read, speak and understand English were recruited. Purposive sampling for qualitative interviews targeted participants with diverse experiences with regard to time since chronic cough diagnosis, gender, age and race. For the DCE survey, adults with chronic cough were recruited through the Lightspeed Health online panel. Specifically, adults (≥18 years) were considered eligible if they had experienced a chronic cough of 8 weeks or longer in duration. Participants were also asked if they had a physician’s diagnosis of chronic cough. Purposeful sampling for the DCE survey targeted diversity with regard to age, race and education.

Statistical analyses
Preference weights

A random-parameter logit (RPL) model in Stata was used to estimate relative preference weights for all attribute levels and trade-offs among improvements in chronic cough symptoms and taste alterations. All attributes were coded such that the omitted attribute levels corresponded to the reference condition in the study. The model allowed preferences to vary among participants following a normal distribution, thus both a point estimate and SD estimate for each attribute-level parameter distribution were obtained. The resulting log-odds parameter estimates can be interpreted as preference weights that indicate the relative importance of treatment outcomes.17

To evaluate the importance of each attribute over the attribute-level ranges included in the study design, we calculated the difference between the level with the highest relative preference weight and the level with the lowest relative preference weight within each attribute. We then used the sum of all the absolute differences as the denominator to show proportion of the total variation contributed by each attribute, and thus the overall relative importance of each attribute.

Minimum acceptable benefit

Relative preference weights from the RPL model were used to compute minimum-acceptable benefit expressed as the minimum improvement in cough symptoms that respondents would require to offset the negative effect of a change in taste. CIs were estimated using the Krinsky and Robb procedure.18

Latent-class analysis

A logit-based latent-class analysis was performed to identify not only subgroups of participants with similar treatment preferences, but also clinical and survey characteristics that associated with choice patterns. To facilitate comparisons across the classes, preference weight for a bitter, metallic, chalky or oily taste change was set at −1 and all the other attribute levels were rescaled accordingly. Further details about the latent class analysis are provided in online supplemental file 1.

Results
Study cohort

Between 28 January 2022 and 11 April 2022, a total of 502 respondents completed the DCE survey. Thirty participants (6.0%) were excluded from further analyses for always choosing either medication A or medication B in all choice questions, resulting in a final sample size of 472 participants.

The mean (SD) respondent age was 56.9 (14.7) years (table 2). Most participants were white (86.2%), female (79.9%) and without a 4-year college degree (69.1%). In addition to chronic cough, most respondents reported having allergies (70.1%) and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (65.9%). In addition, 44.1% of participants reported having asthma and 30.5% reported having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

§As reported by the patient.

COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; DCE, discrete choice experiment.

The majority of participants (347/472, 73.5%) reported having received a specific diagnosis of chronic cough by a physician (table 2). Patients with physician-diagnosed chronic cough were more likely to have increased cough frequency, cough intensity and disruption caused by cough as measured by the Cough Severity Diary (online supplemental table 1). Most respondents reported a current cough (79.4%), with predominant cough timing roughly equally divided among daytime, night-time, and both day and night (table 3). Over 25% of respondents reported coughing 20 times or more per hour during the time of day where their cough was worst. Greater than one-third of respondents reported having seven or more intense cough attacks each week.

Categorical variables presented as frequency (proportion); continuous variables presented as mean (SD).

*Among respondents who coughed more than 20 times per hour, the mean (SD) cough per hour was 37.5 (14.0).

†Among respondents who experienced more than seven intense coughing attack per week, the mean (SD) number of cough attacks per week was 18.8 (7.9).

‡Among respondents who have experienced a taste change.

§P value calculated using Fisher’s exact test.

One hundred and eighty-nine (40.1%) of respondents reported a prior occurrence of taste alteration from any experience (table 3). Among participants who reported a prior taste alteration, 39.2% experienced decreased ability to taste some kinds of foods, 36.5% experienced an inability to taste some kinds of foods at all and 38.6% experienced a metallic, chalky, oily or bitter taste to foods. The sample was about equally divided between those who thought inability to taste either salty foods or sweet foods would be worse.

Participant preferences for treatment attributes

Participants discriminated well among cough-related attribute levels, indicated by relative preference weights being significantly different from one another (p<0.001, figure 2). In general, participants preferred an improvement in cough symptoms, including less coughing during the night and day along with fewer intense cough attacks. With regard to taste changes, the absence of any taste change was logically most preferred, followed by the inability to taste sweet or salty foods. A bitter, metallic, chalky or oily taste was least preferred. There was no significant difference in relative preference weights between inability to taste salty foods and inability to taste sweet foods (p=0.77). Online supplemental table 2 contains the full set of preference estimates.

Among the attributes evaluated, the frequency of intense cough attacks was the most important to participants (relative importance weight 33%; 95% CI: 31% to 36%), followed by taste change (relative importance weight 25%; 95% CI 22% to 28%), frequency of night-time coughing (relative importance weight 23%; 95% CI 21% to 26%), and frequency of daytime coughing (relative importance weight 18%; 95% CI 16% to 20%, figure 3). All relative-importance weights were significantly different from each other (p<0.001), with the exception of taste change and frequency of night-time coughing (p=0.44), indicating these attributes were of similar importance.

Participant trade-offs among treatment attributes

Participant willingness to make trade-offs was assessed by estimating a minimum improvement in cough symptoms needed in order for respondents to tolerate a change in taste. To accept a bitter, metallic, chalky or oily taste change, participants required either: (1) reduction in night-time cough frequency from 20 to 0 times per hour along with a reduction in daytime cough from 20 to 18 (95% CI 14 to 23) times per hour; (2) reduction in daytime cough frequency from 20 to 0 times per hour and a reduction in night-time cough from 20 to 13 (95% CI 9 to 17) times per hour or (3) a reduction in intense cough attacks from seven times per week to twice (95% CI 1 to 3) a week. A less pronounced improvement in cough symptoms was required to accept an inability to taste sweet or salty foods. Specifically, participants required either: (1) a reduction in night-time cough from 20 to 13 (95% CI 11 to 16) times per hour; (2) a reduction in daytime cough from 20 to 12 (95% CI 9 to 16) times per hour or (3) a reduction in intense cough attacks from 7 times per week to 5.6 (95% CI 5 to 6) times a week.

In a sensitivity analysis that was limited to participants who received a diagnosis of chronic cough by a physician, there was no difference in preferences or trade-offs in comparison to the entire cohort (online supplemental figure 1).

Internal validity testing

On average, respondents correctly answered three of four comprehension questions, and generally improved in the later comprehension questions. Fewer than 1 in 20 participants (4.7%, n=22) always selected the treatment alternative for which one specific attribute had the most desirable level (eg, they always chose the treatment with improvement in night-time cough). Specifically, 6 participants (1.2%) always dominated on frequency of night-time coughing, none on frequency of daytime coughing, 12 (2.5%) on frequency of intense cough attacks and 4 (0.8%) on taste change. A sensitivity analysis excluding participants who dominated on an attribute did not change results.

Latent-class analyses

Based on Bayesian information criterion and Akaike information criterion statistics, three latent classes were identified. A three-class latents model also was parsimonious, plausible and decreased classification errors. The model predicted that 62% of participants were best represented by class-1 preferences, 20% by class-2 preferences and 19% by class-3 preferences.

Class-1 preferences are characterised by being most concerned about intense cough attacks and least concerned about potential taste changes (figure 4A). For participants with class-1 preferences, all cough-related attributes were more important than taste changes, and a less pronounced improvement in cough attributes was required to accept taste disturbances. For example, they were willing to accept a treatment that caused a bitter, metallic, chalky or oily taste as long as it reduced either: (1) night-time cough frequency from 20 times to 9 times per hour; (2) daytime cough frequency from 20 to 6 times per hour or (3) intense cough attacks from 7 to only 5 times per week. In contrast, class-2 preferences are characterised by the desire to avoid certain taste changes. For these participants, the possibility of a bitter, metallic, chalky or oily taste was about 4–5 times more important than any cough attribute (figure 4B). Even a treatment that offered a complete resolution of all cough symptoms would not be acceptable if it were accompanied by a bitter, metallic or chalky taste. Class-3 relative preference weights were disordered with low precision and most were not significantly different from zero (figure 4C).

Relative preference weights for participants with class-1 preferences (A), class-2 preferences (B) and class-3 preferences (C). Participants had a 61.7% chance of having class-1 preferences, a 19.6% chance of having class-2 preferences and an 18.7% chance of having class-3 preferences. Error bars indicate 95% CI.

Of the prespecified clinical and survey characteristics examined, only cough frequency, comprehension quiz score, time spent on completing the survey, and smoking status were found to be associated with class membership. Specifically, both class-1 and class-2 membership significantly associated with a higher score on the comprehension quiz and a baseline cough frequency greater than 20 times per hour during the worst time of day (online supplemental table 3). Class-1 membership was also associated with spending more time on completing the survey. In contrast, class-3 membership significantly associated with performing poorly on the comprehension quiz questions and spending less time on completing the survey. Participants with class-3 preferences also were more likely to be current smokers and less likely to have a baseline cough frequency greater than 20 times per hour. Most clinical characteristics, including measures of cough severity, did not vary significantly between participants’ with relatively high probability of having class-1, class-2 or class-3 preferences (online supplemental table 4).

Discussion

Patients with refractory chronic cough currently have limited therapeutic options. Recent trials demonstrate P2X3 receptor antagonist gefapixant offers a significant reduction in cough frequency, but taste-related adverse events are common. We evaluated participants’ willingness to accept trade-offs between improvement in chronic cough symptoms and risk of taste-alteration treatment-related side effects. Our findings revealed that participants with chronic cough were willing to accept some taste disturbances in exchange for improved efficacy of chronic cough treatments. Specifically, participants would be willing to tolerate a bitter, metallic, chalky or oily taste change, which was the least preferred taste disturbance, if a cough treatment resulted in either (1) elimination of night-time cough along with a slight reduction in daytime cough; (2) elimination of daytime cough along with a pronounced reduction in night-time or (3) reduction in intense cough attacks from 7 to 2 times per week. Notably, a less pronounced improvement in cough symptoms was required to accept an inability to taste sweet or salty foods.

Prior work has demonstrated that chronic cough has a negative impact on quality of life,19 however, few studies have evaluated relative importance of different cough-related attributes. A strength of this study is the incorporation of qualitative interviews to inform selection of attributes and attribute levels that influence treatment preferences in patients with chronic cough for the DCE survey. Through the DCE, we found that the frequency of intense cough attacks was the most important cough-related attribute to participants, followed by night-time coughing and then daytime coughing. Previous studies reporting on patient experience with chronic cough have described intense cough attacks as prolonged explosive coughing either after a single breath or between several breaths.20 21 Patients have characterised the loss of control associated with cough attacks as well as adverse sequelae after their occurrence, including dizziness, fatigue and chest tightness.22 23 As the first DCE in chronic cough, the current findings add to prior qualitative research by evaluating the extent to which participants are willing to trade improvements in cough attacks for side effects, underscoring their relative importance.

The importance of nocturnal cough compared with daytime cough was somewhat surprising, as objectively measured cough frequency in patients with chronic cough is lower at night than during the day.24 In fact prior work suggests most episodes of nocturnal cough occur while patients are already awake,25 and that sleep inhibits cough through mechanisms such as decreases in cough reflex sensitivity.26 However, studies evaluating the impact of chronic cough on patients report increased sleep disruption and fatigue.19 27 Additionally, nocturnal cough frequency correlates with cough-related quality of life.24 This DCE supports assessment of patient perceived impact on sleep in future cough-targeted clinical trials given the relative importance to participants.

This study identified two distinct preference patterns across participants with chronic cough. Participants with class-1 preferences, prioritised all cough-related attributes, whereas participants with class-2 preferences, prioritised the avoidance of a bitter, metallic, chalky or oily taste change. Interestingly, the proportion of participants with class-2 preferences in this study was similar to the proportion of clinical trial participants who discontinued gefapixant due to taste related adverse events.7 Somewhat surprisingly, a participant’s personal cough frequency or severity did not influence the likelihood of having class-1 versus class-2 preferences. Additionally, there was also no significant difference in responses to cough impact questions derived from the Cough Severity Diary among participants with class-1 versus class-2 preferences. Notably, current smokers were more likely to belong to class-3, whose treatment preferences were less-pronounced, and thus less likely to contribute to overall study results. The heterogeneity in preferences emphasises the importance of considering each individual patient’s perspective in clinical decision-making. Each patient may have a unique set of preferences that cannot be inferred based on demographic or clinical characteristics, and benefit–risk trade-offs will need to be made on an individual basis in the clinic.

This study has several limitations. First, the study design did not limit enrolment to participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough, and we relied on a participant’s self-reported chronic cough experience. However, about 80% of participants were experiencing a current cough and about 75% had been given a specific diagnosis of chronic cough by a physician. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis limiting the cohort to participants who had received a diagnosis of chronic cough by a physician produced consistent results. In addition, more pronounced treatment preferences were noted in participants with a baseline cough frequency greater than 20 times per hour. It is thus likely that the preferences identified in this study primarily reflect those of patients with refractory chronic cough. Second, while patients are likely very familiar with their cough, even patients who have experienced taste disturbance in the past may not be familiar with the types of taste alterations evaluated in this survey. In addition, blockade of P2X3 receptor activation could cause many types of taste disturbances,28 29 not all of which were included in this study. However, our DCE focused on the most severe types of taste disturbance experienced by clinical trial participants. Third, the attribute list is not comprehensive, and other attributes relevant to taste disturbance (ie, duration or reversibility), cough (ie, control or duration of cough attacks) or medication cost that all may be important to participants were not included. While including every attribute was not possible, the completion of qualitative interviews to guide DCE development helped to ensure attributes most important to patients were included. Finally, treatment choices in hypothetical settings may not fully correspond to actual behaviour, which is mediated by many factors, including clinical practice and health insurance coverage. However, recent research has shown that in some circumstances, DCEs are able to predict actual choices.30

There have been calls from regulatory agencies to place greater emphasis on the patients’ perspective, including quantitative measures of patients’ treatment preferences.31 DCEs provide important information about attributes that are most valued by patients and the willingness of patients to accept trade-offs between efficacy and side effects. This study provides essential insights into preferences of patients with chronic cough and demonstrates that participants with chronic cough are willing to accept some taste alteration for improved efficacy of chronic cough treatments.

Abstract
Background:

Chronic cough, defined as a cough lasting 8 or more weeks, affects up to 10% of adults. Refractory chronic cough (RCC) is a cough that is uncontrolled despite comprehensive investigation and treatment of comorbid conditions while unexplained chronic cough (UCC) is a cough with no identifiable cause despite extensive evaluation of comorbid conditions. RCC and UCC are often poorly controlled. Understanding individuals’ lived experience of the symptoms and impacts of these conditions may guide therapeutic strategies.

Objectives:

The primary objectives of this study were to assess respondents’ perceptions of the key symptoms of RCC and UCC and the impacts of RCC and UCC and their symptoms on well-being, health-related quality of life, work productivity, and social relationships.

Design:

Qualitative study.

Methods:

This study enrolled 30 adults with physician-diagnosed RCC or UCC. Two trained qualitative researchers conducted individual, in-depth telephone interviews using a semi-structured interview guide. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and systematically analyzed to identify content themes.

Results:

A total of 15 respondents with RCC and 15 with UCC were included in the study. Many respondents had RCC or UCC for a long duration (median 9 years, range: 0–24). Half of the respondents reported having a coughing episode at least once daily. Only 40% of respondents reported that medication had improved their symptoms. In over half of the respondents, RCC or UCC hindered communication, caused embarrassment, frustration, and worry, and lowered quality of life. Perceptions of meaningful treatment benefits in RCC or UCC varied widely across respondents.

Conclusion:

RCC and UCC remained poorly managed in many individuals and were associated with a wide range of symptoms and cough triggers that hindered daily activities and reduced emotional well-being. Understanding individuals’ lived experiences may inform the development of RCC and UCC therapeutic strategies.

Plain language summary

Patient-reported experiences with refractory or unexplained chronic cough: a qualitative analysis

Chronic cough, particularly refractory and unexplained chronic cough, remain poorly managed in many individuals and are associated with a wide range of symptoms and cough triggers that hinder daily activities and reduce emotional well-being. Currently there are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for refractory or unexplained chronic cough. Understanding the experience and treatment preferences of individuals with these conditions may help inform the development of new therapies and clarify the potential impact of such therapies on the lives of individuals with chronic cough. Using in-depth interviews, the present study comprehensively evaluated individuals’ experience with refractory or unexplained chronic cough and treatment priorities, a research area that has not been well-studied. This study detailed broad-ranging physical, behavioral, and emotional impacts of chronic cough, which hindered individuals’ social well-being.

Introduction

Chronic cough, defined in current clinical guidelines as a cough lasting 8 weeks or more,1–3 affects 4–10% of adults worldwide, with a higher prevalence in Europe and North America compared with other world regions. 4 Individuals with chronic cough often report uncontrollable bouts of coughing, sometimes in response to minor triggers, such as laughing, speaking, or changes in the ambient temperature. 5 Although smoking significantly increases the risk of chronic cough, chronic cough has an appreciable prevalence in individuals who have never smoked. 6 Among former or never smokers, chronic cough is associated with older age, female sex, abdominal obesity, exposure to environmental triggers, and underlying health conditions, including asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper airway cough syndrome, or bronchiectasis.6–8

Chronic cough frequently continues for years or decades, leading to substantial physical and emotional symptoms, including fatigue, urinary incontinence, cough syncope, dysphonia, depression, and anxiety. 9 In some individuals, cough persists despite extensive guideline-recommended evaluation and treatment of comorbidities, a condition referred to as refractory chronic cough (RCC). 1 An estimated 12–40% of adults with chronic cough have an unexplained chronic cough (UCC), in which an underlying cause of cough cannot be identified despite rigorous evaluation of comorbid conditions. 10

Cough hypersensitivity syndrome (CHS) or neurogenic cough encompasses the spectrum of cough-related conditions or unexplained cough.10,11 RCC and UCC are clinically challenging conditions that can be frustrating for both patients and clinicians. In the absence of US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for RCC and UCC, patients with these conditions may receive therapeutic interventions, such as off-label use of medications and behavioral/speech therapy, but without adequate benefit.12,13 However, a range of new therapies for chronic cough are currently being evaluated, and optimism is growing regarding the potential to successfully manage cough that is refractory to standard treatments.14,15 The real-world success of chronic cough therapies may be affected by patient-related factors. 16 Therefore, understanding the experience and treatment preferences of individuals with RCC or UCC may help inform the development of new therapies and clarify the potential impact of such therapies on the lives of individuals with chronic cough.

Currently, evidence regarding individuals’ lived experience with RCC or UCC is limited. 17 While previous studies have evaluated treatment preferences among individuals with chronic cough due to severe asthma and COPD18–20; to our knowledge, none has assessed treatment preferences among individuals with RCC or UCC or attempted to quantify the minimum desired efficacy for chronic cough treatments. The objectives of this study were therefore to assess respondents’ perceptions of the key symptoms of RCC and UCC and the impacts of RCC and UCC and their symptoms on well-being, health-related quality of life, work productivity, and social relationships. Further objectives of the study were to identify respondents’ treatment priorities and to quantify respondents’ minimum desired and ideal treatment-related changes in chronic cough.

Methods
Study design and population

In this study, we conducted in-depth interviews regarding respondents’ experience with chronic cough and their expectations about the benefits of cough treatments. Interviews were conducted from February to November 2021 with 30 enrolled adults, aged 18 years or older, who had a physician-confirmed diagnosis of RCC or UCC and were able to read and understand English. To ensure that the study sample was representative of individuals with RCC or UCC, the following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) immunocompromised individuals, (2) diagnosis with chronic cough resulting from invasive respiratory tract instrumentation or smoking, (3) diagnosis with a comorbid condition that could exacerbate symptoms of chronic cough or confound interview results, (4) history of substance abuse within the past year, (5) psychiatric disorder that would interfere with the study interview, (6) exposure to someone with COVID-19-related symptoms or a positive test for COVID-19, and (7) participation in a study of an investigational medicinal product within the prior 30 days. Approval to conduct the study was granted by the institutional review boards of RTI Health Solutions and the study sites. Informed consent was conducted and documented for all interviews before carrying out interviews. In one study site (site 2), verbal informed consent was conducted; at the other study site (site 1), written informed consent was also conducted. An unsigned copy of the consent form was given to all study participants before conducting the study interview. The study follows the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative reserach (COREQ) guidelines for qualitative research. 21

Participants were recruited through convenience sampling at two specialty clinics for chronic cough (site 1: Center for Cough, Largo, FL, USA and site 2: Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA) in the United States. Potentially eligible participants were identified through chart review or clinical evaluation at clinic visits; a standardized screening form was used to confirm respondents’ eligibility (Supplemental Appendix A). Soft targets for recruitment were used to enhance the diversity of the participant sample regarding age, sex, ethnicity, education, cough origin (treatment versus unexplained cough), and disease subgroups (gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and upper airway cough syndrome).

In-depth interview

Recorded interviews of approximately 1 h were conducted by two experienced research RTI Health Solutions team members, one of whom led the discussion while the other recorded detailed field notes. Interviews were undertaken via a secure teleconference line or password-secured, web-based system. During the interview, a semi-structured interview guide was used to elicit participant responses concerning their experience with chronic cough symptoms, triggers, and impacts. The interview guide included open-ended and probing questions, such as the following: ‘What, if any, triggers do you experience that seem to cause or worsen your symptoms?’; ‘What, if anything, do your symptoms interfere with your ability to do?’; ‘Tell us about feelings or emotions you have experienced due to your experience with chronic cough.’

Respondents were also asked to describe the minimum meaningful change in cough intensity or frequency that they expected from new treatments. Interview guide questions were developed based on a targeted literature review on the symptoms and impacts of chronic cough that we conducted before study initiation (see Supplemental Appendix B for the search strategy). Audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed verbatim by a medical transcriptionist. Transcripts included no personal identifiers; a unique subject identification number was used instead of a name to identify study respondents.

Immediately following each interview, the two interviewers documented their thoughts regarding the interview’s themes, such as the respondent’s experience of symptoms and the respondents’ perceptions about the impacts of chronic cough. The same two interviewers then conducted a line-by-line coding of the interview transcript to identify key themes and responses using a coding framework. A saturation grid was developed to record all symptoms reported by respondents during the interview. Respondent demographics, clinical symptoms, and cough diagnoses were extracted from medical charts by the study investigators and used to describe the study population. A descriptive analysis of respondents’ response data was conducted using percentages, means, and medians to evaluate trends in the overall sample and by category of RCC and UCC.

Symptoms and triggers of chronic cough

Regardless of the duration of diagnosis, respondents were precise in describing the characteristics of their cough. Less than half of the respondents (43%) reported having a productive cough or a cough that led to mucus or excessive mucus production and 57% described their cough as dry cough (Table 2).

Cough frequency

Respondents highlighted the frequency of cough as a distinguishing aspect of the condition. Half of the respondents reported experiencing a coughing episode at least once daily, up to multiple times per hour, while other respondents reported experiencing coughing intermittently. Many respondents reported experiencing seasonal or day-to-day fluctuations in the frequency of cough, with some expressing frustration at the unpredictability of their coughing (Table 3).

Cough severity

Cough severity was also a defining characteristic of respondents’ experience with this condition. Respondents described a spectrum of cough severity ranging from throat clearing to severe, uncontrollable coughing episodes or ‘fits’. Coughing ‘fits’ were described as embarrassing or frightening, as they could cause one to leak urine, gag, vomit, become short of breath, feel faint, or feel physically exhausted. Respondents expressed concern over how they may appear to others when they cough, even if the coughing is mild (Table 3).

Twelve respondents (40%) reported that, over time, their cough had become more frequent or severe or was accompanied by additional or changing symptoms. For example, some respondents had developed hoarseness or lowering of their voice. However, 13 respondents (43%) reported diminished cough severity following treatment.

Associated symptoms

RCC and UCC were associated with multiple symptoms, most frequently were the sensation of postnasal drip (80%), hoarseness or changes in voice (77%), tickle or lump in the throat (73%), shortness of breath (63%), excessive mucus (57%), and fatigue or tiredness (50%; Table 2). Respondents with RCC reported a similar frequency of symptoms as respondents with UCC. Many respondents reported experiencing multiple symptoms (Supplemental Table 1).

Respondents described some symptoms, such as hoarseness and postnasal drip, as irritating, while other symptoms were considered distressing or severe. For example, shortness of breath was described as frightening or potentially dangerous, as some respondents worried about not having enough air to live or stay conscious. Similarly, gagging or vomiting due to cough or coughing-related fatigue, sometimes related to sleep disruption, were described as disturbing or draining. Some respondents said that their coughing caused substantial physical discomfort (e.g. pulling a muscle, sore ribs, back pain), and several female respondents indicated that they experienced urinary incontinence during coughing. Respondents’ descriptions showed the distressing nature of chronic cough symptoms (Table 3).

Triggers

In some respondents, bouts of cough were unpredictable, while in others cough was caused or worsened by specific triggers. Among the cough triggers reported most often by patients were environmental irritants (67%; Table 4). Respondents cited an array of environmental irritants as cough triggers, including cold or warm ambient air, pollen, mold, dust, pet dander, air conditioning, and smells, such as bleach, spray cleaners, candles, fragrances, and diesel fumes (Table 3).

Singing or speaking, especially when prolonged, excited, or loud, was also frequently cited as a cough trigger (67%; Table 4). Other cough triggers reported were changing body position (37%), exercise (30%), stress (27%), and eating or drinking (23%). These individuals reported having seen multiple specialists, in some cases over a period of years, before determining that their cough was due to hypersensitivity.

Psychosocial and behavioral impacts of chronic cough

Chronic cough affected respondents’ daily functioning, often hindering social interactions (Table 3). Over half of the respondents (57%) reported that coughing interfered with their ability to communicate, especially by phone or when talking for a long time, leading to strain in personal and professional relationships (Table 5). About one-third of respondents reported that coughing impeded their socializing, caused them to limit their social interactions with close family or friends, or triggered feelings of stigmatization. This trend was intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some respondents expressed determination to maintain social interactions despite their coughing.

RCC, refractory chronic cough; UCC, unexplained chronic cough.

For almost half of the respondents (47%; Table 5), coughing disrupted their sleep or that of their partner, sometimes for years, leading to daytime tiredness and poorer quality of life. Notably, some respondents reported being so desensitized to their condition that they were unaware of their nighttime coughing. Some respondents reported cough-related impacts on food choices and participation in sports, exercise, or hobbies, but few reported impacts on productivity at work or home. The frequency of coughing-related impacts on daily function was similar among respondents with RCC and those with UCC.

Respondents reported that chronic cough contributed to negative emotions, compounding the burden of physical symptoms. Seventy percent of respondents expressed frustration at the persistence of their condition and the lack of effective treatments (Table 5). Many respondents (57%) reported feeling embarrassed by their cough, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; embarrassment was most frequently reported as the most burdensome symptom of chronic cough (Table 6). Worry, stigma, depression, anxiety, and irritability were other emotional impacts often reported by respondents, with nearly half indicating that cough diminished their quality of life (Table 5). The emotional distress caused by chronic cough was apparent in respondents’ comments (Table 3).

Coping strategies for chronic cough

Respondents reported using various strategies to cope with chronic cough. Eight respondents reported the current use of one or more medications for symptom alleviation, including gabapentin, amitriptyline, inhalers, or antihistamines. Respondents also used non-pharmacological strategies, such as taking cough drops or lozenges, drinking water or a hot beverage, doing breathing exercises or relaxation techniques, and walking away to avoid disturbing others.

Perceptions of chronic cough treatments

Most respondents had sought medical treatment for their cough, with many reporting substantial delays in receiving a diagnosis. Fewer than half of the respondents (40%) reported having experienced an improvement in symptoms due to medication use.

Respondents expressed a range of views regarding their ideal cough treatment. Concerning treatment effects, most respondents (67%) prioritized improving the physical symptoms of cough over improving emotional well-being, noting that physical improvements would subsequently enhance social and emotional well-being. Most respondents cited reductions in the frequency or intensity of coughing or elimination of coughing as key characteristics by which they evaluate a new treatment. Some respondents stated they would evaluate a new treatment by weighing its effectiveness in reducing cough, cough severity, and cough-associated symptoms against the tolerability of treatment-related side effects.

Respondents’ minimum meaningful change in cough following a new treatment varied and appeared to be related to the severity of the respondent’s cough. A few respondents with intense or frequent coughing indicated that any reduction in cough frequency would be considered a meaningful change in their health state. For most respondents, however, a meaningful improvement meant a ‘noticeable’ improvement in their cough, with subjects noting a range of a 25–50% reduction in cough frequency. A few respondents reported that they had experienced a substantial improvement in the severity of their cough with a new treatment, with one respondent stating that he would expect future treatments to meet or exceed this benchmark. Some respondents described meaningful treatment-related changes in terms of their cough experience, such as no coughing at night, less frequent throat clearing, easier breathing, less mucus production, or less frequent medication dosing. Respondents’ comments show a wide variation in perceptions of meaningful treatment benefits (Table 3).

A conceptual model of chronic cough

The findings of a review of the chronic cough literature that we conducted were further informed by the current study. This, in turn, supported the development and refinement of a conceptual model of chronic cough symptoms, diagnosis, and impacts (Figure 1). This model highlights RCC and UCC as key diagnostic categories of chronic cough and shows the extensive impacts that chronic cough may have on respondents’ well-being, regardless of the underlying cause.

Discussion

In this qualitative study, we evaluated individuals’ experience with RCC and UCC, finding that many had a persistent, debilitating cough that was sometimes so severe that it impacted their daily lives and activities and had emotional consequences. Respondents’ symptom burden was exacerbated by sequelae, including breathlessness, exhaustion, and physical pain. Extensive psychosocial impacts were also observed, as cough often hindered respondents from communicating or interacting with others and engendered feelings of frustration, embarrassment, and fear. A novel insight of this study is that patients’ expectations regarding meaningful treatment benefits appeared to vary according to the severity and frequency of cough.

In the current study, respondents highlighted the frequency and severity of cough as fundamental aspects of their experience with RCC or UCC. Other studies of RCC and UCC have similarly identified cough frequency as a defining characteristic of disease severity and a key determinant of patients’ psychological and social well-being.22–24 Similar to our study, other studies have also reported cough intensity and the physicality of intense coughing as key facets of individuals’ perception of the severity of chronic cough.17,23,24 We found that, for many individuals with RCC or UCC, the disruptive nature of cough was exacerbated by its unpredictability, a finding that accords with a 2021 observational study of UCC. 24 The wide range of chronic cough symptoms described in the current study, including hoarseness, fatigue, vomiting, and shortness of breath, have been widely observed in other studies of chronic cough,17,24–29 underscoring the importance of these symptoms to patients’ experience. Two findings of the current study, to our knowledge, have not previously been reported: RCC and UCC patient subgroups experience a similar frequency of symptoms, and a patient’s symptom profile may change over time.

Diminished communication emerged as the most frequently reported daily function impact of chronic cough, affecting over half of the study patients. This finding is consistent with the understanding that trivial mechanical exposures, such as talking and laughing, are key cough triggers in patients with cough hypersensitivity 30 and reports that interrupted conversations and loss of voice are common adverse effects of chronic cough.23,24,26,29 RCC and UCC further impacted the social dimension of individuals’ lives by engendering feelings of embarrassment and stigma, which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and contributed to individuals’ limiting their social interactions. Similar findings concerning stigma and social isolation among patients with chronic cough have been reported by other studies,17,29,31,32 including a UK survey in which 64% of respondents stated that cough disrupted their social life. 28

In the present study, we found that cough disrupted sleep in 47% of respondents. In many,25,29,32,33 but not all studies, 24 sleep disruption has been identified as an important adverse impact of chronic cough, affecting 30–80% of respondents. However, the role of disturbed sleep in the well-being of individuals with chronic cough is complex. Sleep deprivation can hinder social functioning, 34 thereby contributing to social isolation among individuals with chronic cough. In contrast to other studies of chronic cough,35–37 few individuals in the current study reported cough-related impacts on work productivity, which may be because most were older adults who may have retired.

Frustration and worry were frequently reported by respondents in this study, as well as in other studies of chronic cough.17,24,28,29,32,38 These emotions may be linked to a challenging healthcare journey, which for refractory and idiopathic conditions, like RCC and UCC, is marked by delayed diagnosis and suboptimal treatment outcomes.39–42 Emotional impacts that are frequently reported in studies of chronic cough are feelings of vulnerability and hopelessness, fear, as well as depression, which affect 53–90% of patients with RCC or UCC.9,12,17,24,26,28,43,44 However, few individuals in the current study expressed feeling depressed, helpless, or hopeless, and indeed some conveyed a sense of humor and resiliency concerning their cough. These divergent findings may be due to differences in the psychological profiles of the patients or to differences in patients’ experience with cough treatments.

Previous research on treatment preferences in chronic cough indicates that patients prioritize easier dosing and administration, improvements in quality of life, and, as in the current study, reductions in physical symptoms.18,19 The range of perceptions regarding meaningful treatment benefits reported in this and other studies may reflect the multiple, and often inter-related, aspects of patients’ therapeutic experience, as well as differences in the phrasing of study questions. Most individuals in the current study considered a 25–50% reduction in cough severity as meaningful. A recent phase IIb study of RCC or UCC participants also found that a ⩾30% reduction in 24-h cough frequency is a meaningful change threshold to define treatment response in chronic cough clinical trials. 45 This information can be helpful in the development of future trials of RCC or UCC treatments.

This study has limitations. As this was a qualitative evaluation, findings were based on self-reported data, which may be subject to bias from patients’ desire to give socially acceptable responses. Enrollment was limited to two clinical sites offering state-of-the-art care; thus, the study may have underestimated the impacts of RCC and UCC that might have been observed in the general population not receiving this level of care. Furthermore, epidemiological and clinical diagnostic criteria used to define chronic cough vary. 46 A 2016 systematic literature review of publications between 1980 and 2013 included 70 studies with the majority (79%) of studies utilizing a ⩾3-month cutoff for chronic cough, 4% of studies using a ⩾8-week cutoff, and 16% studies not specifying a cutoff. 46 Future chronic cough studies should use a standard clinical definition of chronic cough that can be used across all chronic cough literature. In addition, the management of chronic cough is challenging and the success of management has varied. In a survey of 1120 individuals with chronic cough, only 30% of individuals felt that ‘their doctor had dealt with their cough thoroughly’. 47 Furthermore, the medication prescribed was judged as having limited (57%) or no effectiveness (36%). 47 While these results align with the results presented here, it is possible that the data captured here reporting that only 40% of respondents reported that medication had improved their symptoms, may not be reflective of a patient’s true treatment pathway as we do not know if the patient took the prescribed medications as directed.

Conclusion

This study comprehensively evaluated individuals’ experience with RCC or UCC and treatment priorities, a research area that has not been well-studied. Using in-depth interviews, this study detailed broad ranging physical, behavioral, and emotional impacts of chronic cough, which hindered individuals’ social well-being. This and other study findings enabled the elaboration of a conceptual model of chronic cough, highlighting the importance of cough as a disease entity, regardless of etiology. Key study insights on patients’ experience of cough and treatment preferences may inform the development of clinical interventions for RCC and UCC, including therapeutic drug trials.

Abstract
Purpose

To evaluate the role of an anti-reflux diet in the treatment of patients with chronic cough caused by laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).

Methods

This prospective observational study included patients with chronic cough (lasting over 3 months) and laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) confirmed by hypopharyngeal-esophageal 24-h multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring (HEMII-pH), according to Dubai criteria. Participants were categorized based on cough severity using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 1 to 10. A VAS < 5 was considered to indicate mild cough, whereas a VAS ≥ 5 were considered to indicate severe cough. Patients with mild cough were treated by anti-reflux diet only, while those with severe cough received additional treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and alginates. After 3 months, treatment effectiveness was evaluated by assessing the reduction in cough severity.

Results

In patients with mild cough, anti-reflux diet alone proved to be effective, yielding improvement in 83.3% of cases. Among patients with severe cough, a combination of anti-reflux diet, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and alginates proved was effective in 81.8% of cases.

Conclusion

Diet alone is an effective and sufficient treatment for mild chronic cough in patients with LPR. For patients with severe chronic cough with LPT, combined anti-reflux measures are effective.

Introduction

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is a condition in which stomach contents flow back into the larynx and pharynx, causing irritation and various symptoms—including chronic cough, defined as a cough lasting over 3 months. More than 20% of patients with chronic cough have confirmed LPR [1]. Specialists approach LPR treatment in different ways. Although there are several established therapeutic options, it is unclear which treatment approach is most effective with the lowest risk of complications. The choice of treatment largely depends on how LPR manifests, and its severity, in each individual patient. An anti-reflux diet and lifestyle modifications are mainstays of LPR management [2]. Additionally, treatment may include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), alginates, prokinetics, H2 receptor antagonists and, in severe cases, surgical intervention. During the last two decades, PPIs have been widely used as first-line treatment for LPR [3]. However, a recent randomized controlled trial [4] found no significant difference in effectiveness between PPIs and a placebo. Moreover, PPI treatment may raise the risk of severe infections by disrupting gut microbiota and affecting immune function [5].

In the present prospective study, we evaluated the effectiveness of an anti-reflux diet as a standalone treatment for patients with mild LPR-related chronic cough. Additionally, we explored the outcomes of combining an anti-reflux diet with pharmacological treatment in patients with severe LPR-related chronic cough. The aim of this study was to contribute to a better understanding of the role of diet in managing LPR-induced cough, and to provide insights regarding when additional therapies are necessary. To our knowledge, this is first study to evaluate the role of anti-reflux diet in patients with chronic cough caused by LPR.

Methods

This prospective cohort study was performed at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital Ostrava, from 2021 to 2024. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the requirements of good clinical practice, and all applicable regulatory requirements. Additionally, this study was approved by the institutional review board of University Hospital Ostrava, and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04984304). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before any procedure was initiated.

Study design

The study inclusion criteria were patients with chronic cough and confirmed LPR. The exclusion criteria were use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or sartans; head and neck cancers or previous radiation therapy in these areas; pulmonary cancers; chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sarcoidosis; and chronic rhinosinusitis. Patients with chronic cough (lasting over 3 months) underwent hypopharyngeal-esophageal 24-h multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring (HEMII-pH) while off anti-reflux therapy. LPR presence was assessed according to the Dubai criteria, with patients having multiple reflux episodes above the upper esophageal sphincter considered to have LPR [6].

Cough severity was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 1 to 10. A VAS score of < 5 was considered to indicate mild cough, whereas a VAS score of ≥5 was considered to indicate severe cough. Patients with mild cough were treated with anti-reflux diet only, while those with severe cough received additional treatment with PPIs and alginates, based on the results of HEMII-pH. After 3 months, treatment effectiveness was evaluated by assessing the reduction in cough severity using the VAS. Treatment was considered successful in cases where cough severity was reduced to a VAS of < 2 in patients with an initially mild cough, and to a VAS of < 4 in patients with an initially severe cough.

Methodology of 24-h multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (MII-pH) monitoring

LPR was diagnosed using a Digitrapper® pH-Z system, with a single-use VersaFlex® LPR ZNID22 + 8R probe. The impedance probe contains a dual pH channel at 0 cm (distal) and 22 cm (proximal), and 8 impedance rings. Prior to assessment, patients fasted and discontinued PPI use. The catheter was transnasally introduced, with the distal pH channel and 6 impedance rings positioned below the upper esophageal sphincter, and the proximal pH channel and 2 impedance rings placed in the hypopharynx above the upper esophageal sphincter. Correct probe position and electrode placement were confirmed using flexible endoscopy.

The 24-hour recording was initially analyzed electronically using software, and then manually verified by an experienced otorhinolaryngologist. A laryngopharyngeal reflux episode was defined as an episode reaching both proximal hypopharyngeal impedance sensors.

A hypopharyngeal acid event was defined as an event with a pH < 4.0; a hypopharyngeal weakly acid reflux event as an event with a pH between 4.0 and 7.0; and a hypopharyngeal alkaline reflux event as an event with pH > 7.0 [7].

Reflux symptoms and findings assessment

The subjective symptoms of LPR and their impact on quality of life were assessed using the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) and Reflux Symptom Score 12 (RSS-12) questionnaires [8]. An RSI score of > 13 and an RSS-12 of > 11 were considered abnormal and suggestive of LPR. Moreover, endoscopic examination of the pharyngeal and laryngeal mucosa was performed, and the results were evaluated using the Reflux Sign Assessment - Short version (RSA) system [9].

Treatment intervention

Patients with mild cough (VAS 1–4) were treated with dietary and lifestyle measures for 12 weeks. The anti-reflux diet included high-protein, low-fat, alkaline, and low-sugar foods. Patients were provided with a written diet plan, and received a thorough explanation of the principles and importance of diet. Patients were also instructed on lifestyle measures, including stress management, remaining in an upright position for at least 30 min after meals, and consuming small portions. The group of patients with severe cough (VAS 5–10) was also instructed in therapeutic dietary and lifestyle measures, and was additionally prescribed medication for 12 weeks, according to type of LPR: acidic reflux, diet + PPI twice daily + alginate twice daily; mixed reflux, diet + PPI once daily + alginate twice daily; and weakly acidic reflux, diet + alginate 2–3 times daily.

Statistical methods

Numerical parameters are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR), or minimum and maximum. Categorical variables are presented as absolute frequency and relative frequency (%). The significance of between-group differences was tested using the Mann–Whitney test, the Chi-square test of independence for contingency tables, or the Fisher’s exact test. The significance level was set to 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, version 4.4.1 (R foundation, Vienna, Austria).

Results
Demographic data and history

For this study, 89 patients were recruited, of whom 9 were excluded because they did not complete follow-up. Thus, the study included a total of 80 patients, comprising 22 men (27.5%) were and 58 women (72.5%). Among these 80 patients, 36 were determined to have mild cough, and 44 severe cough. Table 1 summarizes the demographic data and history of patients in both groups. The groups notably differed in gender distribution, with significantly more women in the severe cough group (p = 0.021). The mild and severe cough groups did not significantly differ in any other demographic data (age or BMI) or patient history.

Improvement after 12 weeks of treatment

In the group of patients with mild cough, after 12 weeks of treatment with diet and lifestyle modifications, 30/36 (83.3%) patients exhibited improvement. In the group of patients with severe chronic cough, after 12 weeks of treatment with a combination of diet, lifestyle modifications, PPIs, and alginate, 36/44 (81.8%) patients exhibited improvement. Overall, treatment was successful in 66/80 (82.5%) patients with chronic cough caused by LPR.

Sub-analysis of patients with mild cough

Sub-analysis of patients with mild cough (Table 3) revealed that the patients who did not response to diet and lifestyle modifications had significantly lower RSI (p = 0.041) and significantly fewer hypopharyngeal reflux episodes on HEMII-pH (p = 0.034).

Discussion

LPR treatment of patients with chronic cough is not standardized, and PPIs are frequently chosen as first-line therapy, although their effect is often insufficient, even at maximum doses. In patients with only LPR symptoms, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of empirical PPI therapy [10]. Moreover, a recent randomized controlled trial revealed no significant difference between PPIs and placebo in terms of effectiveness for persistent throat symptoms [4]. This limitation stems from the fact that PPIs are primarily designed to reduce stomach acidity, rather than to prevent reflux episodes [11]. Moreover, long-term PPI use is linked to various health risks, including kidney disease, liver issues, cardiovascular complications, dementia, gastrointestinal infections, nutrient deficiencies, and neurological side effects [12].

Recently, there has been a shift toward studying the effects of dietary and lifestyle interventions as first-line treatment for LPR. For many patients with LPR, dietary measures such as a high-protein, alkaline, plant-based diet with low sugar content are sufficient treatment [2]. Smith et al. demonstrated a significant correlation between high calorie and fat intake and the intensity of cough symptoms [13]. Similarly, Yeakel et al. found that dietary and lifestyle changes yielded subjective improvement of chronic cough in 60% of patients with LPR [14].

The pathophysiology of LPR involves the retrograde movement of gastric contents into the larynx and pharynx, which causes inflammation and irritation, and can lead to chronic cough among other symptoms. Kikuchi et al. reported the presence of LPR and micro-aspiration of gastric contents into the larynx in a patient with chronic cough [9]. Dietary modifications that minimize acidic and reflux-inducing foods play a crucial role in reducing the frequency and intensity of reflux episodes. However, patient adherence to dietary recommendations is essential for the long-term success of non-pharmacological treatment. Patient noncompliance can result in treatment failure [15]. Therefore, our study also focused on thorough patient education about the dietary regimen. We provided detailed list of foods and drinks that are unsuitable for an anti-reflux diet, as well as those that are suitable. Patients also received a detailed dietary plan in written form, and dedicated sufficient time to patient education.

MII-pH impedance monitoring is currently the gold standard for LPR diagnosis. However, this procedure is often quite uncomfortable for patients, which sometimes results in incomplete testing. The results of our present study indicate that in patients with mild chronic cough and symptoms or signs suggestive of LPR, anti-reflux dietary measures can be implemented immediately, without the need for uncomfortable and semi-invasive HEMII-pH testing.

Our results demonstrated that an anti-reflux diet alone was effective for patients with mild chronic cough, with improvement observed in over 80% of cases. This conclusion is consistent with growing evidence emphasizing dietary and lifestyle modifications as key first-line treatments for LPR management, especially in patients with mild symptoms. Interestingly, our results showed greater improvement with the anti-reflux diet among patients with mild cough, higher initial RSI scores, and a higher number of reflux episodes on HEMII-pH. This suggests that if patients with mild symptoms do not show improvement after following an anti-reflux diet, the addition of PPIs and alginates is unlikely to lead to further improvement. It is likely that in this patient group, the cough is caused by other factors.

Conclusion

An anti-reflux diet alone was an effective and sufficient treatment for patients with mild chronic cough caused by LPR. In clinical practice, these findings may encourage a shift away from the empirical use of PPIs and semi-invasive diagnostic methods for patients with mild cough symptoms.

Abstract
Background

Chronic cough is a common symptom encountered by healthcare practitioners. The global prevalence of chronic cough is 9.6%, with a female predominance. The aim of our study is to reveal the sex differences in prevalence and severity of chronic cough in South Korea, stratified by age and etiology.

Methods

This study included adult patients with chronic cough who were recruited from 19 respiratory centers in South Korea. Patients completed the cough numeric rating scale (NRS) and COugh Assessment Test (COAT) questionnaire to assess the severity and multidimensional impact of cough.

Results

Among the 625 patients, 419 (67.0%) were females, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:2.03. The mean age was 49.4 years, and the median duration of cough was 12 weeks. The mean NRS and COAT scores were 5.5 ± 1.8 and 9.5 ± 3.6, respectively. Female patients were older (45.3 ± 15.4 vs. 51.6 ± 15.2, P < 0.001) and more likely to have asthma/cough variant asthma (CVA) (26.7% vs. 40.8%, P = 0.001) than male patients. There was no difference in the duration or severity of cough between sexes, regardless of the cause. The male-to-female ratio was lower for upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma/CVA, and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), but not for eosinophilic bronchitis (EB) or unexplained cough. The mean age of female patients was higher in UACS and asthma/CVA, but not in EB, GERD, or unexplained cough. The majority (24.2%) fell within the age category of 50s. The proportion of females with cough increased with age, with a significant rise in the 50s, 60s, and 70–89 age groups. The severity of cough decreased in the 50s, 60s, and 70–89 age groups, with no significant sex differences within the same age group.

Conclusion

The sex disparities in prevalence and severity of cough varied significantly depending on the age category and etiology. Understanding the specific sex-based difference could enhance comprehension of cough-related pathophysiology and treatment strategies.

Graphical Abstract

INTRODUCTION

Cough is a common symptom that physicians in various healthcare settings, ranging from clinics to tertiary hospitals, can easily encounter. Cough is classified based on its duration as acute, subacute, or chronic. Chronic cough is defined as a cough lasting more than 8 weeks.1,2 Common causes of chronic cough include cough-variant asthma (CVA), upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), eosinophilic bronchitis (EB), and cough-related gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).3,4 Chronic cough is associated with significant physical, psychological, and social morbidities, as well as a reduced quality of life.5,6 Global surveys indicate that the overall prevalence of chronic cough is 9.6%, suggesting that a considerable number of people suffer from this condition.7 Prior global epidemiologic studies consistently documented a female predominance of approximately two-thirds in the male-to-female ratio. This trend is particularly evident in the European population and indicates higher cough sensitivity in females.8 However, a recent study from China revealed no discernible disparities between males and females, with a male-to-female sex ratio of approximately 1:1.9 The aim of this study is to evaluate the sex difference pattern in South Korea, stratified by age and etiology. Gaining insight into the actual status of sex-related disparities in chronic cough further enhances our understanding of the underlying mechanism behind its development, which can benefit treatment strategies.

METHODS
Study design and population

The detailed study design has been described previously.10 Briefly, adult patients (> 18 years of age) with chronic cough lasting more than 8 weeks were recruited from 19 respiratory centers in South Korea from March 1, 2016 to February 28, 2018. Participants who were currently smoking and those who lost follow-up for the evaluation of treatment responsiveness were also included in the present study. Only chronic cough patients who sought medical attention for the first time were included, while those who were already receiving regular follow-up were excluded. Pulmonary specialists in each hospital evaluated the cause of chronic cough according to the Korean cough guideline.2 Following a comprehensive history taking that included patients’ medical information, such as smoking habits, accompanying symptoms, and medication usage, all patients underwent chest radiography as the initial diagnostic test. Subsequently, additional diagnostic tests for common causes were performed in a step-wise manner, based on symptoms suggesting potential etiologies. Patients with suspected abnormalities on plain chest radiography or with chronic respiratory disease, such as overt asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis-destroyed lungs, or lung cancer, were excluded. Additionally, pregnant women and patients taking cough-inducing medications were excluded. Age ranges were categorized into six groups by 10-year increments (≤ 29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, and ≥ 70 years). Participants completed the cough numeric rating scale (NRS) and COugh Assessment Test (COAT) questionnaire during their first visit. The cough NRS ranges from 0 (no cough at all) to 10 (maximal cough). The COAT is a simplified version of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire developed to evaluate the severity and multidimensional impact of cough.11 The COAT consists of five components: cough frequency, limitation of daily activities, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and hypersensitivity to irritants. All factors are scored on a unified scale ranging from 0 to 4, resulting in total scores ranging from 0 to 20. A higher score indicates a more severe cough.

Statistical analysis

Patient characteristics are presented as means and standard deviations, or medians with 1st and 3rd interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous variables, and as relative frequencies for categorical variables. The student’s t-test was used to compare the continuous response variables, such as age and the COAT scores. The χ2 test was used to compare the categorical variables, such as sex and comorbidities. In order to account for the differences in age and smoking status among each etiology and sex, age and smoking status were incorporated into logistic regression models for sex in multivariable analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using the R Project software (version 4.3.1, https://www.r-project.org/).

Ethics statement

This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Inje University Ilsan Paik Hospital approved the study protocol (IRB No. ISPAIK 2017-12-025) and waived the need for informed consent as none of the patients were at risk.

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics

This study included 625 patients with chronic cough who completed both questionnaires and the necessary diagnostic work-up (Table 1). The mean age was 49.5 years, and the median duration of cough was 12 weeks (IQR, 8−28). A total of 206 (33.0%) males and 419 (67.0%) females were enrolled, resulting in male-to-female ratio of 1:2.03. The mean COAT score was 9.5 ± 3.6, and the mean NRS score was 5.5 ± 1.8. Considering the causes of chronic cough, 287 patients (45.9%) were diagnosed with UACS, 226 (36.2%) with asthma/CVA, 45 (7.2%) with EB, and 84 (13.4%) with GERD (Fig. 1). Twenty patients (3.2%) were unable to determine their cause of cough, while 134 participants (21.4%) had multiple causes. Supplementary Table 1 provides a summary of the baseline characteristics of enrolled patients according to each etiology. The mean age of UACS patients was 49.6 ± 15.2 years, and 66.9% of them were female. In UACS patients, asthma/CVA, EB, and GERD were present in 30.3%, 4.2%, and 9.8% of cases, respectively, and 40.8% had multiple causes. In asthma/CVA, the mean age (52.0 ± 14.8 years) and proportion of females (75.7%) were both higher compared to the overall population. A total of 38.5% and 9.7% of asthma/CVA patients had UACS and GERD, respectively, and 42.9% had multiple causes. The mean age for patients with EB was 47.5 ± 15.4 years, and 55.6% of them were female. UACS and GERD were present in 26.7% and 8.9% of EB patients, respectively, and 42.2% had multiple causes. The mean age of patients with GERD was 49.9 ± 14.8 years, and 66.7% of patients were female. UACS, asthma/CVA, and EB were identified in 33.3%, 26.2%, and 4.8% of GERD patients, respectively, and 50.0% had multiple causes. In patients without a definite cause of cough, the mean age (48.4 ± 15.3 years) and the proportion of females (60.0%) did not differ significantly; however, the COAT score was lower (7.2 ± 3.1). The proportion of sexes (73.1%) in patients with multiple causes was not different, but the mean age (52.5 ± 14.3) and the COAT scores (9.0 ± 2.9) were higher compared to the overall population. The proportions of patients with multiple causes were 87.3%, 72.4%, 14.2%, and 31.3% in UACS, asthma/CVA, EB, and GERD, respectively. A Venn diagram for the causes of cough is presented in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Sex differences in etiology

Female patients were significantly older than male patients (52.3 ± 14.8 vs. 44.0 ± 14.7, P < 0.001), and more likely to have asthma/CVA (40.8% vs. 26.7%, P = 0.001; Table 1). The duration of cough was not different between male and female patients (12 [8, 24.25] vs. 12 [8, 28] weeks, P = 0.570). The severity of cough, as measured by the NRS (5.4 ± 1.9 vs. 5.5 ± 1.7, P = 0.775) or COAT (9.5 ± 3.5 vs. 9.4 ± 3.6, P = 0.885), did not differ statistically between the sexes. Table 2 provides a summary of the baseline characteristics of enrolled patients according to each etiology stratified by sex. Except for asthma/CVA (26.7% vs. 40.8%; P = 0.001), the proportions of UACS (46.1% vs. 45.8%; P > 0.999), EB (9.7% vs. 6.0%; P = 0.124), GERD (13.6% vs. 13.4%; P > 0.999), unexplained cough (3.9% vs. 2.9%; P = 0.661), and multiple causes (17.5% vs. 23.4%; P = 0.112) were not different between sexes. Multivariable analyses were performed adjusted for age and smoking status due to the demographic differences between the sexes. Female sex was only significantly associated with asthma/CVA in univariable and multivariable analyses (Supplementary Table 2). The male-to-female ratio was statistically lower for UACS (1:2.02, P < 0.001), asthma/CVA (1:3.11, P < 0.001), and GERD (1:2.00, P = 0.002) but not for EB (1:1.25, P = 0.456) or unexplained cough (1:1.50, P = 0.564) (Fig. 1). The Venn diagrams comparing the etiology of cough in males and females are presented in Fig. 2. The sex differences for each cause of cough are summarized in Table 2. The mean age of female patients was significantly higher than that of males in UACS (52.3 ± 14.8 vs. 44.0 ± 14.7, P < 0.001) and asthma/CVA (53.3 ± 14.2 vs. 47.8 ± 16.0, P = 0.016), but not in EB (48.6 ± 16.5 vs. 46.2 ± 14.3, P = 0.623), GERD (50.1 ± 15.5 vs. 49.5 ± 13.5, P = 0.856), unexplained cough (51.8 ± 13.0 vs. 43.1 ± 17.8, P = 0.221), and multiple causes (53.5 ± 14.6 vs. 50.0 ± 13.3, P = 0.213). Regardless of the cause, the mean duration of cough was not significantly different between the sexes. The mean COAT scores of female patients were significantly higher than those of males in EB (10.3 ± 3.7 vs. 8.4 ± 2.3, P = 0.045). However, the mean COAT scores were lower in unexplained cough (5.6 ± 1.2 vs. 9.6 ± 3.7, P = 0.032). The density plots for age and COAT distribution are depicted in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.

Patterns of cough according to age category and sex

According to age category, patients were divided into six groups, with the majority (24.2%) being in the 50–59 year age group (Table 3). The proportion of female sex increased with age category and was significantly higher in the age groups of 50–59 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06–3.41), 60–69 years (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.40–5.13), and 70–89 years (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.14–4.91) (Supplementary Fig. 4). Except for a higher prevalence of asthma/CVA in the 40–89 years age group and multiple causes in the 60–89 years age group, the prevalence of each cause was similar across all age groups (Supplementary Table 3). The proportion of females with UACS serially increased starting from the age group of 50–59 years, which was statistically significant. The proportion of females with asthma/CVA increased in a similar manner, with a significantly higher rate in the 60–69 year age group. On the contrary, in patients with multiple causes, the proportion of females decreased starting from the 30–39 year age group, reaching the lowest proportion in the 40–49 year age group, and then began to increase in the 50–59 year age group, resembling a U-shaped pattern (Fig. 3). The ORs for females in each age category for each etiology are summarized in Supplementary Table 4.

DISCUSSION

The chronic cough population in Korea was predominantly female, with male-to-female ratio of 1:2.03. Female patients were older and had a higher prevalence of asthma/CVA than male patients. However, cough duration and severity were not different between the sexes. Patients with UACS and asthma/CVA were also predominantly female, and female patients were older than male patients with similar cough severity. The male-to-female ratio was comparable for EB, and there was no significant difference in age between the sexes; however, female patients had more severe cough compared to that in males. In GERD, females were more prevalent than males, and neither the mean age nor the COAT score differed between males and females. The male-to-female ratio was also comparable for unexplained cough, and the mean age did not differ between the sexes, however, females had a lower COAT score than males.

Global epidemiologic studies have repeatedly demonstrated sex-related differences in chronic cough.12 In order to ascertain the pattern in one of the East Asian countries, we examined the sex-related differences in chronic cough in South Korea and analyzed the effect of age and etiology on this pattern. The male-to-female ratio in South Korea was 1:2.03, which is consistent with the ratios reported in previous global reports. To explain the cause of these sex-related disparities, several theories have been suggested. Fujimura et al.13 performed a capsaicin cough challenge test on healthy nonsmokers and discovered that female participants displayed a reduced threshold, regardless of their age. Kelsall et al.14 assessed cough frequency and cough reflex sensitivity in chronic cough patients, and discovered increased night-time cough frequency and cough reflex. Our study revealed that these sex-related disparities were attributable to asthma/CVA but not UACS, EB, or unexplained cough. Women have a higher likelihood of developing asthma, which is approximately 10.5% higher than that of men. Nevertheless, asthma is more prevalent and more severe in males under the age of 18 years.15,16 The prevalence of asthma in women begins to rise after puberty and becomes more prevalent by the age of 20.17 The difference continues to widen in adults over the age of 35 years and appears to narrow after menopause, although it does not entirely disappear.18,19 Considering the consistent pattern change of the male-to-female ratio in asthma and chronic cough, a higher prevalence of asthma in female patients could be suggested as one of the causes of female predominance in chronic cough patients. Female hypersensitivity is commonly believed to influence cough duration and severity; however, no discernible distinction was found between males and females irrespective of the etiology, with the exception of asthma/CVA. Higher prevalence of asthma in female patients could be suggested as one of the causes of female predominance in chronic cough.

Our study found that the age group of 50–59 years had the highest prevalence of chronic cough, consistent with results in previous research.12,20 This finding could be attributed to UACS. The proportion of females with chronic cough increased with age, although the severity of cough decreased with age. In addition, there was no sex difference within the same age group. There had been a limited study that specifically examined the disparities in quality of life between males and females due to chronic cough.

Sex-related differences in the prevalence of chronic cough may be due to genetic, hormonal, and socioeconomic factors.21,22 Our study found that the percentage of females with chronic cough increased with age in all categories below 70–89 years. Given the consistent increasing trend, except in cases of multiple causes, linking these sex differences to hormonal or socioeconomic effects is challenging.

Several limitations should be acknowledged in this study. First, we could not evaluate the longitudinal change or treatment outcome of sex-related disparities due to the cross-sectional nature of this study design. Further follow-up data is required to ascertain this outcome. Second, because we used predefined data, we were unable to collect additional clinical information, including detailed medication histories and laboratory results. Third, in addition to age groups, various socioeconomic health determinants can have diverse impacts on disease; however, we were unable to evaluate this effect due to the lack of data. Lastly, we cannot be certain whether all of the comorbidities are responsible for the cough. Further study is needed to determine the generalizability of our results to other populations.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that sex disparities in cough prevalence, demographic characteristics, and severity varied significantly according to age category and etiology. Our study findings could enhance the comprehension of cough-related pathophysiology, particularly with regard to age, sex, and etiology. Understanding and addressing the structure of sex-based differences could improve targeted screening and diagnostic strategies for chronic cough. Through this analysis, sex- and age-specific etiologic approach for chronic cough can be developed, which consequently can lead to more effective and personalized approaches for diagnosis, treatment, and management, ultimately leading to better patients’ outcomes.

Abstract
Background:

Chronic cough, a cough lasting >8 weeks, includes refractory chronic cough (RCC) and unexplained chronic cough (UCC). Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are needed to better understand chronic cough impacts that matter most to patients. The 19-item Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), an existing PRO measure of chronic cough, assesses impacts of cough across physical, psychological, and social domains. However, the content validity of the LCQ evaluating these concepts in patients with RCC/UCC had not been established.

Objectives:

To evaluate the content validity of the LCQ in patients with RCC/UCC.

Design:

A cross-sectional, qualitative interview study.

Methods:

First, previously completed qualitative interview results in adults with RCC/UCC (N = 30) were evaluated and mapped to LCQ concepts. Next, a clinical cough expert reviewed each LCQ item and assessed the salience of its concepts for patients with RCC/UCC. Finally, semistructured interviews—including both concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing—were conducted in adults with RCC/UCC (N = 20) to elicit a comprehensive set of participant experiences and to assess the appropriateness of using the LCQ in this population.

Results:

Concepts reported in the past and present qualitative interviews were included across all LCQ items, and most impacts reported to be the “most bothersome” were assessed in the LCQ. In the current study, all participants indicated that reduced cough frequency would be an important treatment target. During cognitive debriefing, each LCQ item was endorsed by ⩾70% of participants. Additionally, participants were generally able to understand, recall, and select a response for each LCQ item. All participants and the clinical expert indicated that the LCQ was appropriate and assessed the impacts most relevant to patients with RCC/UCC.

Conclusion:

Our findings support the content validity of the LCQ and demonstrate that this measure is fit-for-purpose and includes important cough impacts in adults with RCC/UCC.

Introduction

Chronic cough, a cough lasting more than 8 weeks, affects up to 10% of adults worldwide.1,2 This challenging condition has been reported in regions across the globe. 1 Types of chronic cough include refractory chronic cough (RCC) or unexplained chronic cough (UCC). 3 RCC persists in patients with comorbid conditions (e.g., asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, rhinitis) despite receiving treatment, whereas in UCC, no underlying causes of cough are identified through guideline-based clinical evaluation.4,5

Chronic cough can last for years or decades, leading to significant morbidity.6,7 While symptoms and impacts of chronic cough vary between patients, physical impacts can include cough syncope, chest pain, hoarse voice, urinary incontinence, sleep disturbances, and exhaustion.3,8,9 In addition to considerable physical impacts, chronic cough is associated with underrecognized yet significant psychosocial impacts.6,9,10 Depressive symptoms, frustration, anxiety, uncomfortable public attention, negative impacts on daily life, hindered social relationships, and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have all been linked to chronic cough.9,11–14 As there are currently no approved treatments for chronic cough, patients need new treatment options that have been developed and evaluated in light of patients’ individual lived experiences.8,15,16 Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures can be used to obtain important patient experience data, including data evaluating outcomes that are most meaningful to patients and ultimately support assessment of novel treatments for RCC/UCC. 16

One such measure, the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), is a valid and reliable cough-specific PRO, with 19 items addressing the physical, psychological, and social impacts of cough.6,17 The LCQ was developed according to accepted standards for PRO measures; it included input from 15 patients with chronic cough and was cognitively debriefed among a separate sample of 104 patients with chronic cough. 6 This measure has been widely used by researchers to assess treatments for chronic cough, 18 has been shown to be responsive to changes in chronic cough impacts,17,19 and has acceptable psychometric properties supporting its use among patients with RCC/UCC. 17 However, subsequent to the development of the LCQ, new regulatory guidance documents were released, most recently by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that place greater focus on the evaluation and documentation of content validity for PRO measures.20,21 Content validity demonstrates how well a measure evaluates its intended construct, ensuring the accuracy, relevance, and representativeness of PRO measures. While the initial development of the LCQ included patients with chronic cough, 6 which by definition includes RCC/UCC, 3 the content validity of the LCQ specifically in patients with RCC/UCC had not been established. In this study, we evaluated the content validity of and the appropriateness of using the LCQ in patients with RCC/UCC through concept mapping and qualitative interviews, in accordance with 2009 20 and 2022 21 FDA regulatory guidance.

Methods
Study design

A cross-sectional, qualitative interview study design was employed. This research included concept mapping to compare the content of the LCQ with data from a previously conducted qualitative study (concept elicitation in RCC/UCC), 14 a clinical expert interview to gauge the appropriateness of the LCQ in an RCC/UCC patient population, and in-depth, novel qualitative interviews with adults who had a clinical diagnosis of RCC/UCC. This study followed the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) guidelines. 22

The LCQ measure

The LCQ is a self-completed PRO measure with 19 cough-specific items addressing the impacts of chronic cough across 3 domains (Physical (items 1–3, 9–11, 14, 15), Psychological (items 4–6, 12, 13, 16, 17), and Social (items 7, 8, 18, 19)). 6 LCQ items are assessed using seven-point Likert response scales with a recall period of 2 weeks. Response scales include 1 = “all of the time” to 7 = “none of the time” for items 1, 3, 5–10, 12–14, 16, and 17; 1 = “every time” to 7 = “never” for item 2; 1 = “none of the time” to 7 = “all of the time” for items 4 and 15; 1 = “all of the time (continuously)” to 7 = “none” for item 11; 1 = “every time” to 7 = “none of the time” for item 18; and 1 = “every time I cough” to 7 = “never” for item 19. Higher domain scores (average score across individual domain items; range, 1–7) and higher total scores (sum of the domain scores; range, 3–21) indicate better health status or less impact of cough.

Concept mapping in a chronic cough study by Bali et al. 14

We examined the results of past concept elicitation qualitative interviews (N = 30) conducted via telephone in adults with a clinical diagnosis of RCC or UCC. 14 Deidentified data from Bali et al., 14 including ethics approval and participant consent details, were on file at the time of this study and have since been published. Concept saturation was reached in the study by Bali et al., 14 and the concepts (i.e., symptoms, impacts, and experiences) reported by the interview participants were extracted. Existing clinical outcome assessments were not evaluated by Bali et al. 14 Therefore, we mapped these qualitative findings to the concepts included in the LCQ.

Clinical expert review

On 16 November 2022, a 60-min telephone interview was conducted with a leading clinical cough expert on the appropriateness of using the LCQ to assess the impact of chronic cough on patients with RCC/UCC. This semistructured interview was facilitated by a detailed agenda; during the interview, the clinical expert reviewed each item of the LCQ, provided feedback on the salience of the concepts included in the LCQ, and noted whether any important impacts of RCC/UCC were missing from the LCQ. Concepts reported or endorsed by the clinical expert were also mapped to concepts included in the LCQ.

Qualitative interviews

In-depth interviews were conducted with a targeted sample of 20 adults 23 living with RCC/UCC (evenly divided across RCC/UCC subgroups) to evaluate the content validity of the LCQ and to determine whether the LCQ could be used as a fit-for-purpose PRO measure for assessing the impact of chronic cough in adults with RCC/UCC. Interviews used a hybrid approach where the first half of the interview focused on concept elicitation and the second half included cognitive debriefing of the LCQ.

Participant recruitment

Participants were recruited through two clinical sites using a convenience sampling method in which adult patients with RCC/UCC who met study criteria were identified prospectively. To be eligible for inclusion, individuals must have been adults (aged ⩾ 18 years) from the US who had chronic cough for ⩾1 year and a clinical diagnosis of RCC/UCC and must have scored ⩾4 on a numerical rating scale assessing cough severity (ranging from 0 = “no cough” to 10 = “extremely bad cough”) over the past 7 days. Participants also needed to read, speak, and understand English, agree to be audio recorded during the interview, and be able to complete the interview via telephone. Individuals were excluded if they had been diagnosed with an illness that could exacerbate symptoms of chronic cough or had other circumstances that could confound interview results (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, current smoker, use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the past 4 weeks, participation in clinical trials). Individuals were also excluded if they had an impairment that may have impacted their ability to provide informed consent or participate in an interview. Complete details of participant inclusion and exclusion criteria are outlined in Table S-1, Supplemental Material. Clinical site personnel contacted patients meeting the screening criteria via telephone or screened patients in person to determine whether they would like to participate in an interview. Potential participants were then given the researcher’s contact information and were asked to call to complete the screening process.

Interview methods

During January–February 2023, each approximately 60-min interview was conducted via telephone. There was no pilot testing, but to ensure that the interviews were conducted in a consistent manner and that the research objectives were met, each interview was conducted by two of three highly experienced qualitative researchers (one who led and one who took field notes during the interview) according to a standardized, semistructured guide; interviewers were females with 5–18 years’ experience in qualitative research (Research Health Outcomes Scientist Margaret Mayorga, MS, MPH; Research Health Outcomes Scientist Mirline Milien, MS; and Executive Director of Patient-Centered Outcomes Assessment Claire Ervin, MPH). Each interview began with an introduction to the interviewers, review of the study purpose and interview format, and collection of verbal informed consent before continuing to the concept elicitation and subsequent cognitive debriefing phases. Outside of names and affiliations, personal details about the researchers were not disclosed, but participants were encouraged to ask any questions throughout the interviews; only the research participants and interviewers were present. During concept elicitation, participants were asked open-ended questions designed to elicit a comprehensive set of participant experiences (i.e., impacts) associated with RCC/UCC. Concept saturation, defined as the point at which no new information is reported by participants, was evaluated between the first 10 and the second 10 interviews.

The next phase, cognitive debriefing, was intended to assess the appropriateness of the US English version of the LCQ for assessing the impact of chronic cough in adults with RCC/UCC. During cognitive debriefing, participants were asked to think aloud and describe their thought process as they responded to each item of the LCQ. The interviewers posed follow-up questions to evaluate how participants interpreted each item, response options, and the ease with which they understood each item. Upon completion of the debriefing, participants were asked if any important RCC/UCC impacts were missing from the LCQ. Each participant completed one single interview; no follow-up or additional interviews occurred.

Data analysis

Descriptive analyses were used to summarize the demographic and clinical data provided by participants at screening for categorical variables (e.g., sex, education level) and continuous variables (e.g., patient’s current age). Standard qualitative analysis methods were applied to the interview data, including interviewer field notes and transcripts, and data were managed via Microsoft Word and Excel. Transcripts from the interview audio recordings were prepared and deidentified by a qualified medical transcriptionist to facilitate data analysis. In addition, each transcript underwent multiple levels of review to ensure accuracy. Interview data were analyzed using applied thematic analysis—the initial qualitative coding framework was based on the content in the interview guide and was adapted to incorporate any new concepts or themes identified during transcript review. To ensure consistency, all coding and analyses were conducted by the same three researchers (Margaret Mayorga, MS, MPH; Mirline Milien, MS; and Claire Ervin, MPH). Themes and concepts identified during the concept elicitation phase of each interview were compared to identify and confirm the RCC/UCC impacts of greatest importance to participants. Similarly, for analysis of the cognitive debriefing phase, LCQ concepts of importance and potential problems with content or comprehension were identified in each interview; these findings were compared with the results of other interviews to document the frequency with which patients reported these concepts and issues. In addition to overall experiences with RCC/UCC, concepts reported or endorsed by participants across both the concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing phases were mapped to concepts included in the LCQ. Deidentified transcripts were used for data analysis and provided only to the study sponsor; interview participants did not provide feedback on the study findings.

Results
Concept mapping in a chronic cough study by Bali et al.

After extracting concepts reported by the Bali et al. 14 concept elicitation study, which comprised 30 participant interviews, we identified that each of the 19 items included in the LCQ was reported as an important concept across patients with RCC/UCC (Table 1). In addition, 13 of the concepts assessed in the 19-item LCQ were reported as among the most bothersome impacts by interview participants in Bali et al. 14 Participants reported a few concepts that were not specifically included in the LCQ (i.e., vomiting or gagging, postnasal drip, fainting or feeling faint, incontinence). However, some of these concepts were commonly described as overlapping/not entirely distinct from concepts included in the LCQ or were concepts that were not salient to the broader (i.e., both male and female) population. Upon further discussion/probing, we found that study participants described vomiting and gagging as associated with mucus or postnasal drip. While the LCQ does not specifically include those items, it does include an item asking about phlegm (mucus), which limits the need for the more distal (vomiting/gagging) or potentially redundant (postnasal drip) items. Likewise, only 10% of the qualitative study participants reported fainting (or feeling faint), and incontinence primarily impacts women. 24 Overall, interview participants in the prior study by Bali et al. 14 consistently described the salience of RCC/UCC concepts that are assessed in the LCQ and the significance of these impacts on their lives.

During the current qualitative interviews, the following coughing impacts were spontaneously reported by one participant each: nosebleed, fainting, broken blood vessels in face, straining of back muscles, interruption of intimacy, headaches, eye pain, and physical activity. Also, the clinical expert indicated that chest discomfort was among the most bothersome aspects of cough. They distinguished chest pain from discomfort.

All 19 LCQ items are represented here, but the following concepts have been grouped: frustrated/fed up (LCQ items 12 and 13) and tired/lack of energy (LCQ items 3 and 15). Check mark (✓) = reported symptom/impact.

Clinical expert review

The clinical expert reported that 17 of the 19 concepts included in the LCQ were relevant to patients with RCC/UCC (Table 1). The two concepts not regarded to be quite as salient were chest pain (LCQ item 1) and phlegm (LCQ item 2). When describing why these concepts were potentially less important to the RCC/UCC patient population, the clinical expert noted that patients more commonly described chest “discomfort” instead of pain and that the coughs associated with RCC/UCC tended to be dry, unproductive coughs. The expert further noted that although the cough itself was dry, some patients do describe a feeling as if phlegm were involved in or a contributing factor to their cough.

The clinical expert described all other concepts assessed in the LCQ as relevant to the RCC/UCC patient population. Furthermore, the expert indicated that the LCQ was the most comprehensive instrument available to assess the impact of cough for patients with RCC/UCC. When asked if any important concepts were missing, the expert noted urinary incontinence as an important concept missing from the LCQ; the expert described urinary incontinence as primarily impacting female patients.

Qualitative interviews
Participant characteristics

A total of 20 interviews (evenly divided across RCC (n = 10) and UCC (n = 10) subgroups) were conducted. The sample was primarily female (n = 19), with one male participant. Participants’ average duration of symptoms was 13.6 years (range, 2–40 years). Table 2 summarizes participant demographics and clinical characteristics provided via self-report at screening. No patients refused to participate after enrollment and interview scheduling.

In the past 7 days, participants rated how bad their cough was on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = No cough and 10 = Extremely bad cough.

RCC, refractory chronic cough; UCC, unexplained chronic cough.

Experiences with cough

When asked to describe their experiences with chronic cough, participants generally described a lengthy journey to seek treatment for and understanding of their unrelenting cough (Figure 1 and Table S-2, Supplemental Material). Factors contributing to this lengthy and often distressing journey centered on the participants’ inability to find healthcare providers who understood their diagnosis and how to potentially treat their cough, as well as the toll their cough took on their (and their families’) lives:

Yeah, I’ve been on such a long journey and it’s almost like everyone just wants to kind of give you a Band-Aid and move on. But when it keeps coming back it’s just frustrating because it’s not like you have a certain condition and they know exactly how to treat it and then therefore it all gets better. It just keeps coming back repeatedly and they just keep throwing the kitchen sink at it every time. [Participant 3, RCC]

Experiences of Cough Reported During Concept Elicitation, Representative Quotes.

RCC, refractory chronic cough; UCC, unexplained chronic cough.

When asked to describe their cough, participants generally described a frequently occurring (i.e., daily) cough commonly associated with a tickly sensation that could occur in short or prolonged bouts. Participants generally noted that the duration and force of their cough made one coughing experience/bout more intense or severe than another. As such, prolonged bouts of coughing were reported to be more severe and were often associated with physical, social, and emotional impacts.

Well, it never stops, but during the day or some days are worse than other days, but no, it doesn’t stop. There isn’t . . . I cannot remember a day that I have not coughed. [Participant 10, RCC]

With a bad and lengthy coughing fit, I feel exhausted. The ones that they’re just very tiring. And there’s the pain and then the exertion and the lack of even breathing. It just takes a toll on my body and mentally as well. [Participant 14, RCC]

Despite trying multiple mitigation strategies (such as sucking on lozenges and sipping water), most participants described a complete lack of control over at least some of their coughing experiences.

Again, I think for me it impacts you emotionally because you feel like I do . . . I try to do everything right. You feel, why? How is this not getting better? How am I not finding a way to control it? [Participant asked rhetorically] [Participant 11, UCC]

Impacts of cough

Participants spontaneously reported many ways in which their lives had been negatively impacted by their often-uncontrollable cough (Table 3 and Table S-2, Supplemental Material). Specifically, 21 impacts were spontaneously reported by ⩾2 participants. The most frequently reported impacts were those that had a psychological or social component to them, such as stigma (i.e., other people thinking something is wrong; n = 18); interference with job and daily tasks (n = 16); lack of control over the cough (n = 15); and annoying their partner, family, or friends (n = 15):

Well, if I’m coughing at the grocery store or something, I go to the. . .an aisle where no one is or something. Or I’ve been known to leave a store and go back out to my car, just so I don’t worry people. My gosh, this person is either very ill or having some sort of attack. You just want to get away at that point in time. [Participant 1, UCC]

My husband has a home office. I can’t be in the same room when he’s doing business because my incessant cough drives him crazy. Yes. My son was living with us, and it was irritating to him as well. He moved out. I don’t know if that was the reason or not. [Participant 20, RCC]

The following coughing impacts were spontaneously reported by one participant each: nosebleed, fainting, broken blood vessels in face, straining of back muscles, interruption of intimacy, headaches, eye pain, and physical activity.

RCC, refractory chronic cough; UCC, unexplained chronic cough.

Of the spontaneously reported impacts of chronic cough, 11 had physical components, including feeling tired/lack energy (n = 13), phlegm (n = 12), and coughing bouts (n = 8):

It’s constant. It doesn’t stop. As far as for more than like maybe 20 minutes, I don’t have a cough. It’s just all day long. [Participant 2, UCC]

When asked to identify the most bothersome aspect of their cough, participants most often described impacts that influenced their desire to participate in social or public events, reporting aspects like embarrassment (n = 10) or stigma (n = 10; Figure 2). Other impacts reported by ⩾2 participants included interrupted daily tasks/work (n = 5), annoyed partner/family/friends (n = 4), anxiety or worry (n = 3), lack of cough control (n = 2), interrupted conversations/phone calls (n = 2), and being frustrated/fed up (n = 2):

When I’m with other people it bothers me most. I can be at a meeting and start coughing, sitting down to dinner, and wanting to have a conversation and I start coughing . . . it’s a bother but I’m used to it, but when I’m with other people it bothers me most. I often have to get up and leave the meeting, if I don’t have water, it interrupts the meeting, and my ability to follow what’s going on in the meeting. It bothers my husband. He will stop talking. ‘I can hear even if I’m coughing.’ He looks at me like ‘ok.’ [Participant 4, RCC]

Most Bothersome Impacts of Cough Reported by ≥2 Participants During Concept Elicitation Participants commonly reported more than 1 most bothersome aspect. Most bothersome aspects, each reported by a single participant (n = 1), included phlegm, coughing bout frequency, unspecified physical pain, interfered with life enjoyment, hoarse voice, urinary incontinence, coughing severity, and physical activity. RCC, refractory chronic cough; UCC, unexplained chronic cough.

After describing the impacts associated with their cough, participants were asked what aspects of their chronic cough they would most want to see change with an effective treatment. The responses were highly consistent in that all participants wanted their cough to stop completely (Figure 3). Furthermore, all participants indicated that any reduction in the frequency and/or intensity of cough would constitute a meaningful improvement and limit the significant impacts associated with frequent, uncontrollable coughing (i.e., physical, psychological, and social impacts):

Well, ideally you would like it to stop completely, but to just have much less of a cough and the severity of it would be helpful. Just not to be coughing all the time and worry about going somewhere and coughing. [Participant 9, RCC]

Well, that I didn’t cough anymore. I would appreciate or be very happy with that. Hopefully, I would be maybe more verbal. That I would feel comfortable speaking at church, in front of a group . . . to be able to just talk and enjoy being with other people. And just not, always wondering when and if I’m going to start coughing. [Participant 4, RCC]

Concept saturation

A total of 21 potential impacts associated with chronic cough were reported spontaneously (by ⩾2 interview participants) across the 20 interviews (Table S-3, Supplemental Material). A total of 20 concepts were spontaneously reported during the first set of 10 interviews, while only 1 impact (worried cough may indicate serious illness) was spontaneously reported in the second set of 10 interviews. Of note, 8 impacts of cough not covered by the LCQ were reported only once each across the 20 interviews, but these were commonly described as being distal to severe coughing bouts. Coughing bout frequency is covered by the LCQ and was captured as a separate concept. Overall, data from the concept elicitation component of the interviews were highly consistent, and concept saturation was achieved with respect to the impacts associated with chronic cough.

Cognitive debriefing
LCQ instructions, response options, and recall period

All 20 interview participants described the LCQ instructions as clear and easy to understand. When asked to describe in their own words what the instructions were asking them to do, participants generally indicated that they were able to think about their cough and select a response option that reflected their experience (Figure 4). No changes to the instructions were suggested or recommended by the participants.

They’re clear. Easy to understand. [Participant 14, RCC]

All participants were able to select a response to each of the LCQ items, using the 7-point Likert response scales, and participants generally indicated that selecting a response was relatively easy. Participants also indicated that the response options across all scales were relatively distinct and that they could describe the difference between response choices:

It was not hard. No, it was not hard, because I do get tired. I was just kind of going between ‘a lot of the time’ or ‘some of the time,’ but really it is ‘a lot of the time’ I end up tired. [Item 3, Participant 15, UCC]

All interview participants reported that it was relatively easy to recall the past 2 weeks when responding to the items and noted that the 2-week recall period was appropriate:

Oh, it’s easy. Two weeks is super easy . . . if you ask me 3 months ago or 3. . .that would have been a lot harder. But 2 weeks is pretty easy to remember back on. [Participant 2, UCC]

LCQ Item–specific responses

For each LCQ item, the number of participants spontaneously reporting a concept and those who endorsed the concept when probed are presented in Figure 5. LCQ item-specific responses from participants with RCC/UCC are summarized in Figure 6 and Table S-4 (Supplemental Material).

Representative Quotes Reported During Item-Specific Cognitive Debriefing of the LCQ LCQ, Leicester Cough Questionnaire; RCC, refractory chronic cough; UCC, unexplained chronic cough.

Seven LCQ concepts were endorsed by all 20 participants. These concepts included lack of control, job/daily task interference, coughing bout frequency, frustrated, fed up, stigma, and interrupted conversations (corresponding to LCQ items 4, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, and 18, respectively) and covered each of the 3 LCQ domains (Physical, Psychological, and Social/Emotional; Figure 6):

It [coughing bout] just means another episode of embarrassment, discomfort. Fear, a little bit of fear. Just episodes of coughing that are serious. I hardly ever just cough to clear my throat. That happens rarely. [Participant 15, UCC, Item 11]

A little of the time. For instance, when I’m in church and I’m coughing or I’m clearing my throat, I’m afraid that somebody else thinks that I’ve got COVID or something like that. [Participant 20, RCC, Item 17]

Interfere with your job, like maybe you have to pause if you’re in a meeting and you were talking and you start coughing. Or even if you go to the grocery store and you’re about to go into the checkout, you don’t want to go up there coughing. So, you wait, go down another aisle, try to hide yourself then go back. [Participant 11, UCC, Item 7]

Most participants reported they could easily understand and answer each item of the LCQ. Although a few participants indicated that some questions were more difficult to respond to than others, all participants were able to select a response they felt was accurate to describe their chronic cough for each of the LCQ items. Eighteen of the 19 concepts included in the LCQ were endorsed by at least 80% of participants (n ⩾ 16). The remaining concept, “sleep disruption,” was endorsed by 70% of participants (n = 14). When probed, those participants who did not experience a specific impact generally indicated that the concept was indeed relevant to assess in a questionnaire that evaluates the impact of chronic cough.

Overall, participants described the LCQ as easy to understand and as a comprehensive assessment of the relevant impacts of chronic cough (Figure 7(a)). When asked whether any important chronic cough impacts were missing from the LCQ, 17 participants indicated that the measure was completely comprehensive (all important impacts were included) (Figure 7(b)). When probed, three participants reported an impact as potentially missing from the LCQ: urinary incontinence (n = 1), sneezing (n = 1), or other bodily impact (n = 1):

It was good. It was easy. It definitely covered all the things that constant coughing is, basically. It covers everything that . . . I can’t even think of anything else that you could add because it just covers everything. [Participant 2, UCC]

Discussion

The LCQ is a rigorously developed HRQOL measure designed to assess the physical, psychological, and social impacts of chronic cough via self-report in adults with clinically diagnosed chronic cough. This robust evaluation of the content validity of the LCQ in adult patients with RCC/UCC was consistent with 2009 20 and 2022 21 FDA guidance for patient-focused drug development. Concepts reported across the concept mapping, clinical expert review, and qualitative interview study components were represented in the 19 concepts included in the LCQ. Also, interview responses during concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing were consistent across RCC/UCC patient populations. Overall, these results support that the LCQ assesses the chronic cough impacts that are most often experienced by patients with RCC/UCC. Furthermore, the evidence presented here supports the content validity of the LCQ and its appropriateness for use in patients with RCC/UCC.

During concept elicitation, participants spontaneously reported 21 impacts associated with chronic cough that included impacts with a social or public component (e.g., stigma; interference with job and daily tasks; lack of control over the cough; annoying their partner, family, or friends). Similar impacts of chronic cough have been reported in other studies, highlighting the emerging importance of assessing these psychological/social impacts in PRO measures like the LCQ.10,11 The psychological and social impacts of cough often occur alongside the physical impacts of chronic cough.3,10 During the concept elicitation phase, over half of spontaneously reported concepts (11 of 21 concepts) had physical components (e.g., feeling tired/lack energy; coughing bouts). Most of the reported physical concepts are included in the LCQ, are widely relevant to the experiences of chronic cough, and are important to consider in the development of new therapies for patients with RCC/UCC.10,11

Because many participants in this study described a lengthy and often distressing journey when seeking clinical treatment for their chronic cough, and because patients with RCC/UCC often experience delays in diagnosis and limited effectiveness of medications, 11 a better understanding of patients’ lived experiences with chronic cough may help guide the development of relevant therapeutic strategies for these patients. While most interview participants in the current study and in Bali et al. 14 prioritized improvements in physical impacts (e.g., reduced cough frequency) over psychological and social impacts, the aspects of cough reported to be the “most bothersome” often included psychological and social impacts (e.g., embarrassment or stigma, interrupts daily tasks/work). Also, all participants reported that a reduction in cough frequency would subsequently reduce the impacts of frequent, uncontrollable coughing, including psychological and social impacts. Overall, these data support the notion that, to evaluate the impacts of RCC/UCC in a meaningful way, measures should assess physical, psychological, and social impacts (all of which are included in the LCQ).

While most chronic cough impacts reported by participants during concept elicitation were included in the LCQ, five spontaneously reported impacts were not directly assessed in the LCQ (i.e., vomit/reflux, nasal drip/sneezing/throat clearing, dyspnea, throat pain/irritation, and urinary incontinence). However, only two of these five concepts (sneezing (n = 1) and urinary incontinence (n = 1)) were reported as potentially missing from the LCQ. Also, most of these impacts (vomit/reflux, nasal drip/sneezing/throat clearing, dyspnea, and throat pain/irritation) were described as conceptually redundant or distal to concepts assessed in the LCQ (phlegm (mucus), coughing bouts, or hoarse voice). Lastly, although most chronic cough patients are female 25 and urinary incontinence is an important impact of cough in women,24,25 the addition of an item specific to the impact of cough on urinary incontinence would not be appropriate for a measure intended for use in a broader population that includes both male and female participants. Overall, findings from the concept elicitation component of the interviews were highly consistent across the sample, and concept saturation was reached.

Participants confirmed during cognitive debriefing that the LCQ was generally easy to understand, and all participants were able to select a response they felt was accurate to describe their chronic cough. Similarly, all participants reported that the 2-week recall was reasonable and appropriate. During LCQ item-specific responses, participants endorsed each of the 19 LCQ items. Participants who did not experience a specific impact, when probed, generally indicated that the concept was relevant to assess in a questionnaire that evaluates the impacts of chronic cough. When asked to provide their overall thoughts regarding the LCQ, all participants indicated that the measure was appropriate and that it assessed the impacts most salient to their experiences with chronic cough. Nearly all (n = 17) interview participants reported that the LCQ was a comprehensive assessment of their chronic cough impacts, with only three participants each identifying a single symptom as potentially missing from the LCQ.

Several valid and reliable PRO instruments are available to assess the impact of cough on HRQOL,18,26 including measures for children (the Parent Cough-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire (PC-QLQ) 27 ) and adolescents/adults (the LCQ6,26 and Cough-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ) 28 ). The LCQ is a 19-item questionnaire with 3 health domains (Psychological, Social, and Physical) scored on 7-point response scales, while the CQLQ is a 28-item questionnaire with 6 domains (Social Psychology, Emotional State, Personal Safety Fears, Somatic Symptoms, Extreme Somatic Symptoms, and Functional Ability) scored on 4-point response scales. 29 The LCQ and CQLQ are both widely used in research and clinical trials to assess the outcomes of chronic cough.6,18,26,28 The LCQ has been available for more than 20 years, and our findings now support its direct use for patients with RCC/UCC, adding to its relevance as a cough-specific PRO.6,17

One limitation of this study is that participant recruitment occurred across two clinical sites and was limited to patients in the US who had chronic cough for ⩾1 year. While participants included only those with a clinical diagnosis of RCC/UCC, the results of this study may not be generalizable to all patients with chronic cough. Additionally, our study only included one male participant; however, several studies report chronic cough affects mostly females.2,25 The results of qualitative interviews are based on self-reported data, which may be subject to recollection bias or the participants’ temptation to provide socially fulfilling responses. However, concept saturation was reached,30,31 which indicates the findings reported here on impacts are representative of patients with RCC/UCC and support the comprehensive nature of the LCQ.

Conclusion

The LCQ is a rigorously developed measure designed to assess the impact of chronic cough on patients with a clinical diagnosis of chronic cough, including patients with RCC/UCC. An extensive evaluation of the content validity of the LCQ in adults with RCC/UCC supports that it is fit for the purpose of assessing the impact of cough. Furthermore, these findings support the LCQ’s ability to (1) assess the chronic cough impacts most commonly experienced by participants with RCC/UCC and (2) represent impacts participants most commonly want to see improved.

Abstract
Background

Right now, epidemiological research examining the connection between blood heavy metal exposure and chronic coughing is still deficient. Therefore, the survey was aimed at the effects of multiple heavy metals on chronic cough.

Method

In this investigation, 2647 individuals from NHANES were included. This study applied multiple statistical models to systematically explore the associations between single and mixed blood metal with the prevalence of chronic cough, including logistic regression, weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) model. Finally, this research conducted mediation analyses to investigate the mediated effects of inflammation on the association between metal and chronic cough.

Result

In the logistic regression model of single exposure, blood cadmium was positively associated with the prevalence of chronic cough (OR: 3.17; 95% CI: 2.08–4.83). Consistent findings from the WQS, BKMR, and SHAP models revealed that cumulative exposure to multiple blood metals was positively linked to chronic cough, with cadmium emerging as the predominant contributor among the five examined metals. Mediation analyses indicated that WBC and neutrophils, with a proportion of 2.74% and 5.06%, respectively, mediated the link of cadmium in blood with chronic cough.

Conclusion

Exposure to heavy metal mixtures was linked to an increase in the prevalence of chronic cough. And blood cadmium may primarily drive this association, with activated inflammation partially mediating it. Our findings offer novel insights into the impact of blood cadmium to chronic cough.

Keywords: Heavy metal, chronic cough, inflammation, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), mediation

1. Introduction

Chronic coughing is a prevalent symptom in respiratory clinics, frequently suggesting the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and nasal diseases [1]. Chronic cough was described by earlier epidemiologic research as one that persisted for more than three months [2]. Current clinical guidelines recommend that chronic cough be characterized by coughing as the only or primary symptom for more than 8 weeks (adults) or 4 weeks (children) [3]. Prior studies have reported a broad range in chronic cough prevalence, spanning from 2.6% to 12.7% [4–8], which may be partly attributed to inconsistencies in its clinical definition. A chronic cough usually indicates an underlying respiratory disease. Even though most specialists have become familiar with the common causes of chronic cough in recent years, 12–40% of adult patients still lack a clear etiology [9]. Since the diagnosis is unclear or long-term treatment is ineffective, some patients’ cough symptoms may persist for years, significantly disrupting their daily routines and occupational functioning [10,11].

While the etiology of chronic cough is multifactorial, environmental factors such as air pollution and occupational exposures have been increasingly recognized as important contributors [3,12]. Heavy metals are ubiquitous in environmental settings, infiltrating the cells of animals, humans, and plants through environmental pathways such as consuming polluted food and water or inhaling contaminated air [13]. It has been found that toxic metal exposure can induce acute and chronic airway inflammation and oxidative stress by stimulating the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, causing respiratory symptoms such as coughing and sputum [14,15]. By applying an unsupervised clustering approach to data from 9,662 subjects, one investigation stratified participants according to heavy metal burden and revealed a strong link between elevated exposure levels and chronic lower respiratory diseases [16]. A meta-analysis indicated that cadmium exposure increases COPD risk [17]. In our previous study, we showed that long-term exposure to residual lead and manganese can affect the onset and worsening of asthma [13,18]. Multiple studies have shown that cadmium triggers pulmonary inflammation by promoting lung epithelial cell death and oxidative stress, primarily through its cytotoxic effects and disruption of redox balance [17,19]. These investigations discover that heavy metal exposure has direct toxic effects on the airways or lung tissue, leading to symptoms such as coughing, and is associated with systemic inflammatory modulation [20].

Nevertheless, epidemiologic research examining the connection between blood heavy metal exposure and chronic coughing is still deficient. Our previous study based on urinary metal concentrations revealed that cadmium in urine had a positive correlation with the prevalence of chronic cough, and that systemic inflammation partially mediated this relationship [21]. Building on these findings, the present study further extends the investigation to blood metal levels. Using data from NHANES, we examined the link between five blood elements (manganese, selenium, lead, mercury, and cadmium) and chronic cough and evaluated potential mediating roles of inflammatory cells.

2. Methods
2.1. Data source

NHANES is a population-based surveillance program designed to monitor health profiles and nutritional status in U.S. residents. This survey analyzed one-cycle data (NHANES 2011–2012) to investigate metal-inflammation interactions in predicting chronic cough. The following populations weren’t included : (1) people lacking diagnostic information for chronic cough; (2) people with missing blood metal; (3) people with missing covariates. Finally, the investigation included 2647 participants. Figure S1 displays the screening flowchart.

2.2. Measurement of blood metals

Whole blood samples were handled, preserved, and transported to the National Center for Environmental Health and CDC for research. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was employed to ascertain metal levels (lead, cadmium, mercury, manganese, and selenium) in the whole blood. Blood metal concentrations below the analytical detection limit were estimated by assigning a value equal to the limit of detection divided by the square root of two.

2.3. Covariates

To help decrease the impact of confusing factors, this survey incorporated covariates. Covariates in this investigation were age, gender, race, education, marriage, smoke, poverty-to-income ratio (PIR; the larger the PIR, the richer the family), body mass index (BMI), chronic airway diseases (CAD), hypertension, alcohol intake, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), eosinophil number, white blood cell number (WBC), lymphocyte number, neutrophil number. In this survey, chronic cough diagnosis was assessed through a structured medical questionnaire administered by trained healthcare professionals as part of NHANES’ standardized interview protocol. Participants were asked the validated screening question: ‘Do you usually cough on most days for three consecutive months or more?’ In the survey, those who responded ‘yes’ to this questionnaire were identified as having a chronic cough [22–24].

2.4. Statistical analysis

Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test, while the Kruskal–Wallis test was employed for continuous variables due to distributional differences. Given the non-normal distribution of blood metal concentrations, a log-transformation was applied to approximate normality before analysis. To explore the relationship between blood metals and chronic cough, multiple statistical and machine learning methods were employed. Spearman correlation was first used to assess inter-metal relationships. SHAP values were then calculated to identify the relative importance and direction of five blood metals in the XGBoost model for predicting chronic cough. The cumulative impact of metal mixtures was evaluated through weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, while bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was adopted to flexibly capture potential non-linear and interactive effects among exposures. Multivariable logistic regression models quantified associations between individual metals and chronic cough, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) was adopted to visualize these relationships. Predictive value was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Mediation effect models examined the impact of inflammatory markers in blood metals–chronic cough relationship after adjusting for covariates. Sensitivity analyses were performed using multiply imputed data, with missing covariate rates below 10%. All analyses incorporated NHANES sampling weights and were analyzed in R 4.4.0. The P-value < 0.05 suggested statistical significance. For further information, please see the supplemental material.

3. Results
3.1. Baseline characteristic

Table 1 summarized the baseline information of investigated populations. The survey encompassed 2,647 individuals aged 40 years or older, with 282 receiving a diagnosis of chronic cough. Some variables, including age, education, PIR, marriage, BMI, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, CVD, CAD, WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, cadmium, and mercury, exhibited statistically significant variations between chronic cough and non-chronic cough populations. Additionally, we discovered mild to moderate correlations among blood metals based on Spearman’s chord diagram (Figure S2).

3.2. SHAP model explored the impact of metal exposure on chronic cough

This study employed SHAP to describe the effect of each blood metal inside the XGBoost model on the chronic cough prevalence (Figure 1). The decreasing order of importance to predict the prevalence of chronic cough was cadmium, mercury, manganese, lead, and selenium. Blood cadmium, manganese, and selenium levels were positively correlated with the prevalence of chronic cough, respectively. Additionally, blood mercury and lead were inversely linked with chronic cough prevalence, respectively. Furthermore, out of the five metal exposures, the ROC results indicated that blood cadmium (AUC = 0.642) had a superior predictive capacity for chronic cough (Figure S3 and Table S1).

The SHAP model provided the corresponding importance of every blood metal on chronic cough.

3.3. Impact of mixed blood metal exposure on chronic cough

The WQS model was employed to discuss the aggregated influence of multiple metal exposures on chronic cough. The WQS analysis revealed that cumulative exposure to heavy metals was positively correlated with chronic cough, even after accounting for confounding variables (Figure 2A). Among the five metals, cadmium had the strongest weight in the WQS index, followed by lead, selenium, manganese, and mercury (Figure 2B). To further characterize these relationships, BKMR was applied to evaluate both joint and individual metal effects. As shown in Figure 3A, higher cumulative metal levels were associated with a marked increase in chronic cough prevalence. The univariate exposure-response curves (Figure 3B) demonstrated that cadmium and selenium levels were positively related to chronic cough. Variations in lead and cadmium levels from 25% to 75% were linked to an elevated prevalence of chronic cough (Figure 3C). There was no interaction between diverse metals (Figure 3D).

3.4. The single effect of each metal exposure on chronic cough

To delineate the independent effects of individual metals, we constructed three progressively adjusted logistic regression models (Figure 4). In the first two models, cadmium and mercury were positively associated with chronic cough. However, even after comprehensive adjustment in Model 3, cadmium retained a robust association (OR: 3.17; 95% CI: 2.08–4.83), indicating that chronic cough risk rose by 2.17 times for each unit increase in blood cadmium. The RCS revealed the non-linear association of cadmium in blood with chronic cough. For the other metals analyzed—lead, mercury, manganese, and selenium—no significant dose-dependent patterns were detected (p > 0.05), as illustrated in Figure S4.

3.5. Mediating effects of inflammatory cells

Mediation effect models were adopted and found that WBC (2.74%) and neutrophils (5.06%) partially mediated the association of cadmium in blood with chronic cough (Figure 5). However, no significant mediation effects were discovered in the link of cadmium in blood and chronic cough via lymphocyte and eosinophil (p > 0.05).

3.6. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis

Additional analyses—including subgroup analyses, interaction tests, and sensitivity analyses—were performed to reinforce the consistency and dependability of the main outcomes. The outcomes displayed the positive link between blood cadmium with the prevalence of chronic cough in both groups, those with and without CAD or occupational exposure (Tables S2–S4), but no significant association was observed with the other four exposures (mercury, manganese, lead, and selenium). There was no interaction between history of CAD and occupational exposure, five blood metals, and chronic cough. Details of the sensitivity analyses are presented in the supplementary materials. Following multiple imputation for all missing covariates, the outcomes remained broadly aligned with the primary findings. In the fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression model, only the link between cadmium in blood with chronic cough retained statistical significance (Table S5). The BKMR model further supported these results, demonstrating a notable increase in chronic cough prevalence corresponding with elevated cumulative metal exposure (Figure S5A), and highlighting the positive association specifically of cadmium in blood with chronic cough (Figure S5B).

4. Discussion

This research unveils previously underexplored patterns linking circulating metal concentrations to chronic cough occurrence, emphasizing the intermediary role played by inflammatory processes. By integrating diverse analytical strategies, we observed that elevated aggregate exposure to blood metals corresponded with a marked rise in chronic cough prevalence. Among the five examined elements, cadmium emerged as the principal driver. Further analysis suggested that this relationship was partially channelled through systemic immune responses, particularly involving WBC and neutrophils.

Our findings indicated that participants with chronic cough were older, smoked more frequently, had lower levels of education and income, and were more likely to have CVD, diabetes, and hypertension, than participants without chronic cough. These results are consistent with those of a large Australian health study [8]. Similar results were found in a prospective questionnaire study [5] in Northern Europe. The higher prevalence of hypertension in individuals with cough was associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) [8]. Smoking and unhealthy lifestyles are common risk factors for chronic cough, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [25]. This may explain why there were more comorbidities in the cough group. A worldwide cross-sectional population-based survey identified three types of cough: productive, nonproductive, and nocturnal [26]. It was noted that all types of coughs are associated with smoking and environmental tobacco smoke [26].

As fine particles or vapours, heavy metals like lead and cadmium can be discharged into the atmosphere via industrial processes, automobile emissions, and smoking [27]. Once inhaled, these substances can reach the alveoli, cross the epithelial barrier, and enter the bloodstream. Their elimination from the body is remarkably slow [14]. Smoking, environmental fumes, or air pollution are the main routes by which people are most likely to be exposed to cadmium [28]. Cadmium is well-known for its capacity to provoke oxidative stress and inflammation in pulmonary tissues [29], has been linked to various pulmonary diseases, such as COPD, asthma, lung cancer, and pulmonary fibrosis [17,30–32]. According to our research, the prevalence of chronic cough increased as the concentration of cadmium in the blood increased. And blood cadmium has an indirect effect on chronic cough through total leukocyte and neutrophil levels. These results are consistent with previous research linking cadmium exposure to respiratory diseases such as COPD [17], suggesting that cadmium may act as a respiratory irritant and pro-inflammatory agent [33].

This survey is consistent with and extend published epidemiological studies on the adverse respiratory impacts of cadmium exposure. Previous investigations have displayed that multiple heavy metal exposures are linked to reduced pulmonary function [17,34,35]. This association appears to be particularly pronounced in rural areas with severe heavy metal pollution, where individuals using solid fuels containing lead, mercury, or manganese may be at an elevated risk [35]. Early-life cadmium exposure has also been shown to increase susceptibility to ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma [36]. Furthermore, cadmium accumulation in the lungs may lead to alveolar epithelial cell injury, promoting pulmonary fibrosis and the progression of chronic lung diseases [37,38]. However, these studies primarily focused on chronic pulmonary diseases or lung function impairment as outcomes, rather than chronic cough per se. Our study contributes new evidence by specifically identifying chronic cough as a distinct respiratory outcome related to cadmium exposure, independent of smoking and other comorbidities.

Cadmium emerged as the most influential metal associated with a chronic cough in our study, supported by both regression-based and machine-learning models. Inhalation of smoke or pollutants can rapidly trigger coughing to clear irritants from the airways [1]. Cadmium exposure also induces oxidative stress, stimulating inflammatory responses by disrupting immune function and promoting the release of inflammatory mediators [17,29]. Chronic cough may become more likely as a result of persistent inflammation. In bronchial epithelial cells, cadmium increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which triggers oxidative stress, triggers mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, and ultimately results in cell death [39]. Oxidative stress further ­promotes tissue damage and inflammation by upregulating pro-inflammatory factors and leukocyte recruitment [40]. Additionally, cadmium impairs mucociliary clearance and damages epithelial barriers, key contributors to chronic cough [41,42]. It also disrupts autophagy, hindering damaged cell removal and intensifying inflammation [28]. Collectively, these mechanisms contribute to airway injury and chronic respiratory symptoms.

Despite the robustness of our findings, several limitations warrant consideration. Firstly, we can’t prove causation as much because of the study’s cross-sectional approach. Second, chronic cough classification relied on self-reported responses to a standardized NHANES questionnaire, which may introduce misclassification bias and does not equate to a physician-confirmed clinical diagnosis. The cross-sectional design also precludes assessment of temporality or access to detailed medical histories. Due to data limitations in NHANES, we could not include detailed information of occupational exposures, such as workplace particulate matter, which may contribute to chronic cough. Finally, this study concentrated on a limited range of inflammatory cells; future work should examine more markers to clarify the mechanisms. These constraints suggest that our findings should be interpreted cautiously, and further research with clinical evaluations and detailed exposure data is needed to confirm these associations.

5. Conclusion

In the survey, exposure to heavy metal mixtures correlated with a rising prevalence of chronic cough. Blood cadmium may primarily dominate this relationship, with activated inflammation partially mediating it. These findings warrant further investigation and may significantly impact public health strategies designed to mitigate heavy metal exposure and reduce the prevalence of chronic cough in the community.

Abstract
Background

Chronic cough is associated with reduced mental and physical health and increased health care resource use. The lack of nationwide data on chronic cough hinders our understanding of the prevalence, demographics, and impacts of chronic cough in China. The aim of this study was to estimate the lifetime and annual prevalence of chronic cough in mainland China and to describe the sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of adults with chronic cough.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study using self-reported information from a nationally representative sample of 20,051 adults. Respondents with chronic cough (daily cough for ≥ 8 weeks) during the prior 12 months were matched to respondents without chronic cough.

Results

We estimated a lifetime prevalence of 7.0% and an annual prevalence of 4.1% for chronic cough among adult residents of mainland China. Affected individuals had a mean age of 43.5 years, and there were no significant differences in prevalence between men and women. Compared to matched controls, the chronic cough group had more comorbidities and included a higher proportion of individuals who had been diagnosed with respiratory and sleep-related conditions. Chronic cough was also associated with significantly worse depression and anxiety symptom severity and health-related quality of life, as well as increased impairment of work and other daily activities and higher rates of all-cause health care resource use.

Conclusions

Chinese adults with chronic cough show a middle age, equal gender distribution. Chronic cough affects an estimated 46.4 million adults in mainland China during their lifetime and is associated with significant individual and health care system burden.

Take home message

Chronic cough affects approximately 4.1% (27.2 million) of adults per year in mainland China and is associated with worse health and health-related quality of life, impairment of work productivity and other daily activities, and increased all-cause health care resource use.

Background

Cough lasting > 8 weeks (chronic cough) is a debilitating condition associated with poor physical and mental health, reduced work productivity and quality of life, and increased health care resource use [1–27]. Many cases resolve via treatment of common underlying causes such as asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), upper airway cough syndrome, and eosinophilic bronchitis, or cessation of prescription drugs that can cause cough as a side-effect [28–30]. However, other cases remain unexplained and/or refractory to treatment. The current evidence-based Chinese clinical practice guidelines for the management of cough recommend treatment of underlying medical comorbidities, consideration of multiple concurrent causes and occupational exposures such as airborne particulates, and empirical treatment (i.e., treatment selection based on the physician’s best judgment) of unexplained/refractory cough with Western and/or traditional Chinese medicines [29].

The estimation of the global and country-specific prevalence of chronic cough has been hampered by the use of differing methodologies and definitions [26, 31]. The global prevalence of chronic cough has been estimated as 9.6% [32], but other studies have estimated lower rates (3.8–5.5%) in the US and Western European countries [11, 12, 15, 33, 34]. Studies of the demographics of chronic cough in China have identified interesting potential differences compared to other national populations. A recent meta-analysis assessed 35 studies of the prevalence of chronic cough in China, conducted in different regions using different methodologies and definitions of chronic cough, and estimated an overall prevalence of 8.8% among adults ≥ 18 years of age when only studies defining chronic cough as daily cough for > 8 weeks were considered [35]. Most of the included studies had small sample sizes and a low-to-moderate grade of evidence.

The primary objective of the current study was to use a nationally representative sample of adults in mainland China to estimate the lifetime and annual prevalence of chronic cough. We also aimed to compare the sociodemographic characteristics and the health-related characteristics and outcomes of adults with and without chronic cough, providing comprehensive nationwide data on the demographics and burden of this condition in China.

Methods
Study design

This was a cross-sectional study using self-reported information from a national online survey.

Study population

The study population comprised residents of China ≥ 18 years of age who had completed the 2020 National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS), a self-administered online questionnaire that is conducted annually in China and other countries. Studies using similar methods have described the prevalence and characteristics of chronic cough in nine other countries and regions that participate in the NHWS (Table 1) [11, 12, 15, 34, 36–39]. The NHWS uses a targeted quota sampling framework to select panelists who mirror the urban adult population of mainland China by age, binary sex, and region of residence using a demographic distribution based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China [40]. The annual sample size for the NHWS in China is approximately 20,000.

Values represent the weighted prevalence of chronic cough. All cited studies used data from the respective country’s/region’s version of the National Health and Wellness Survey, using the same methodology as in the current study

All NHWS respondents were asked whether they had experienced chronic cough (defined as daily cough for ≥ 8 weeks) at any time during their life, and also specifically during the prior 12 months. To compare individuals with and without chronic cough during the prior 12 months, respondents who had experienced chronic cough were matched (nearest neighbor without replacement) at a 1:3 ratio to respondents with no chronic cough who had similar (≤ 0.2 SD) chronic cough propensity scores. Propensity scores were calculated based on age, sex, interaction of marital status and household income, and a modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score. The modified CCI score excluded chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to its close association with chronic cough.

Ethics and consent

All NHWS participants read an informed consent statement and provided electronic confirmation of their consent to participate. Respondents who provided consent were assigned a unique code that can only be linked to personal information by a team within Oracle Life Sciences that was not involved in the current study. The NHWS protocols and questionnaires were reviewed and granted an exemption by the Pearl Institutional Review Board (Protocol #20-KANT-228).

Study measures

The NHWS collects information on respondents’ sociodemographic and health-related characteristics, all-cause health care resource use (e.g., number of visits to general and specialty health care providers from a list provided) and other health-related outcomes, and diseases experienced and diagnosed. It also includes several validated patient-reported outcome instruments. Depression severity was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale (PHQ-9) [41], and anxiety symptoms using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) [42]. Health-related quality of life was assessed using 3 instruments: the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Survey Version 2 (SF-12v2; QualityMetric Inc., Lincoln, RI, USA) [43–46]; the SF-6D Health Utility Score [45, 46]; and the EuroQol 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5 L™; EuroQol Research Foundation) [47]. Finally, the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire assessed health-related absenteeism (percent work hours missed), presenteeism (percent impairment experienced while at work), and overall work productivity loss (combined absenteeism and presenteeism score) as well as activity impairment (percent impairment of daily non-work activities) during the prior 7 days [48].

Statistical analysis

The unweighted lifetime and annual prevalence of chronic cough were calculated as the number of respondents indicating they had ever experienced daily cough for ≥ 8 weeks (or had experienced daily cough for ≥ 8 weeks within the last 12 months, respectively), divided by the total number of NHWS respondents. Lifetime and annual prevalence calculations were also performed stratified by age category, binary sex, smoking status, and sex stratified by smoking status. To adjust for potential sampling biases, weighted lifetime and annual prevalence estimates were calculated by projecting the unweighted prevalence rates from the study sample to the full urban adult population of China using data from the National Bureau of Statistics in China [40]. Sampling weights were calculated using rake weighting / random iterative methods and were based on age, sex, region, and rurality [49].

For comparisons between respondents who had experienced chronic cough during the prior 12 months and matched respondents who had not (matching strategy described in ‘Study population’ section above), the matched groups were first compared using kernel density plots to visually compare the propensity score groupings and ensure that their characteristics were balanced (Supplementary Fig. 1). Respondent characteristics and outcomes for each group were then analyzed using descriptive statistics including percentages, means, SDs, medians, and ranges. Characteristics were compared between the matched groups using bivariate analyses (t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables). Differences with two-tailed p-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Prevalence of chronic cough among adults in mainland China

A total of 20,051 adult residents of China completed the 2020 NHWS, of whom 1,389 (6.9%) reported having experienced chronic cough (daily cough for ≥ 8 weeks) during their lifetime and 812 (4.0%) during the prior 12 months (Table 2). These proportions were weighted to the 665.8 million total adult national population to estimate a lifetime prevalence of 7.0% (~ 46.4 million individuals) and an annual prevalence of 4.1% (~ 27.2 million individuals) for chronic cough in China.

AP-values were calculated separately for unweighted and weighted values using the two-tailed chi-square test

B Prevalence data were weighted to national demographic data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China [40]

Current or former smokers of cigarettes or other tobacco products had a significantly higher weighted annual prevalence of chronic cough compared to respondents who had never smoked (7.0% versus 3.1%; P < 0.001). The weighted annual prevalence of chronic cough was also statistically significantly different between age categories (P < 0.001). The distribution was bimodal, with the highest proportions observed for individuals ≥ 75 years of age (7.4%) and 30–39 years of age (5.0%). A similar trend was found with different age groupings for 50 years and above ( 50–59, 60–69, ≥ 70 years) (data not shown). The weighted annual prevalence of chronic cough was similar for male versus female respondents (4.2% versus 3.9%). Stratified by smoking status, the unweighted annual prevalence of chronic cough was higher among female than that among male current/formal smokers (10.2% versus 6.3%), however among never smokers, no sex difference was found for the annual chronic cough prevalence (Supplementary Table 3).

Sociodemographic characteristics of matched respondents with and without chronic cough

Eleven respondents with chronic cough during the prior 12 months had no qualifying matches, 9 had 1 match, 4 had 2 matches, and the remainder had 3 matches. The matched analyses therefore compared 801 respondents with chronic cough to 2,381 respondents without chronic cough.

Respondents who had experienced chronic cough within the prior 12 months had a mean (SD) age of 43.5 (15.9) years and a median (range) age of 41.0 (18.0–112.0) years, and 51.3% were male (Table 3). Continuous age was used as a matching criterion, but the age group distribution was different between the matched groups (P < 0.001). A majority of respondents with chronic cough had a medium or high income (68.5%) and were married or cohabiting (79.3%). Significantly higher proportions of respondents with chronic cough had ≥ 2 sources of health insurance compared to the control group (78.2% versus 61.4%) and a primary insurance type of Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (39.8% versus 31.9%), while a significantly lower proportion had a primary insurance type of Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (39.0% versus 44.1%; P < 0.001 for all comparisons).

E China’s universal medical insurance system includes two major insurance schemes: (1) Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) and (2) Urban and Rural Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URRBMI). The UEBMI is a compulsory medical insurance scheme financed by employees and their enterprises. The URRBMI, which integrates the former New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) and Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI), covers self-employed individuals, unemployed residents, and those not enrolled in employer-sponsored insurance

Health-related characteristics of matched respondents with and without chronic cough

A significantly greater proportion of respondents with chronic cough had ≥ 1 comorbidity compared to matched controls (37.2% versus 24.7%; P < 0.001; Table 4); this group also had a significantly higher mean (SD) unmodified CCI (0.56 [0.94] versus 0.37 [0.79]; P < 0.001; Fig. 1). Experiencing chronic cough was also statistically significantly associated with being a current or former smoker (42.3% of respondents with chronic cough versus 27.3% of respondents with no chronic cough) and consuming alcohol (≤ 3 times per week, 60.0% versus 45.7%; ≥4 times per week, 8.7% versus 6.0%; P < 0.001 for all comparisons; Table 4).

Respondents who reported having chronic cough in the last 12 months were matched 1:3 by chronic cough propensity score (based on age, gender, interaction of marital status and income, and modified CCI, excluding COPD) with respondents with no chronic cough in the last 12 months. Values are displayed as the mean of the continuous scores for each measure. P-values were calculated using the two-tailed t-test. All values were statistically significantly different (P < 0.001) between the chronic cough (N = 801) and the no chronic cough (N = 2,381) groups, except modified CCI (p = 0.134)

Individuals with chronic cough had significantly worse mental health than did matched controls. Among the chronic cough group, the mean (SD) score on the PHQ-9 scale of depression symptom severity was 7.48 (5.04) and the mean (SD) score on the GAD-7 scale of anxiety symptom severity was 5.80 (3.99), versus 4.49 (4.66) and 3.42 (3.63), respectively, for the matched control group (P < 0.001 for both comparisons; Fig. 1). Significantly more respondents with chronic cough also reported experiencing moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression (30.2% versus 13.2%; P < 0.001) and anxiety (18.2% versus 7.5%; P < 0.001; Table 4).

Respondents were also asked whether they had ever experienced or been diagnosed with specific medical conditions; they were not asked whether these conditions occurred before or after they experienced chronic cough. Significantly greater proportions of the chronic cough group had ever been diagnosed with each of the respiratory conditions on the list provided (P = 0.002 for emphysema and P < 0.001 for allergies, asthma, hay fever, chronic bronchitis, and COPD) as well as heartburn (P < 0.001) and other conditions (Supplementary Table 1). Significantly more respondents with chronic cough also reported having ever experienced or being diagnosed with each of the sleep-related conditions on the list provided, i.e., insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep apnea, and other sleep difficulties (P = 0.031 for the percent diagnosed with narcolepsy and P < 0.001 for all other comparisons; Fig. 2). Chronic cough was also significantly associated with regularly experiencing each of the specific sleep problems on the list provided (P = 0.005 for difficulty staying awake and P < 0.001 for all other listed problems; Supplementary Table 2).

P-values were calculated using the two-tailed chi-square test. All values were statistically significantly different between the chronic cough (N = 801) and the no chronic cough (N = 2,381) groups (p = 0.031 for the percent diagnosed with narcolepsy; P < 0.001 for all other comparisons)

Health-related outcomes of respondents with and without chronic cough during the prior 12 months

Chronic cough was associated with significantly worse health-related quality of life. Among respondents with chronic cough, the mean (SD) score on the SF-12v2 scale was 46.75 (7.53) for the physical component and 44.89 (7.86) on the mental component (a clinically meaningful difference compared to the accepted population benchmark mean of 50), versus 51.11 (7.31) and 49.11 (8.14), respectively, among matched controls (P < 0.001 for both comparisons; Table 5). The mean (SD) SF-6D health utility score was significantly lower in the chronic cough group, at 0.64 (0.09) compared to 0.73 (0.13) for the control group (P < 0.001)—again, a clinically meaningful difference on this scale. Respondents with chronic cough also had significantly lower mean (SD) scores on the EQ-5D index (0.84 [0.19] versus 0.93 [0.13]; P < 0.001) and the EQ-5D VAS (74.85 [18.89] versus 83.20 [17.19]; P < 0.001) than did matched controls, indicating a worse health state. The chronic cough group also reported a significantly greater extent of impairment of daily activities, as measured by the mean (SD) percent work absenteeism (10.47 [15.25] among those with chronic cough versus 4.77 [12.34] among those without), work presenteeism (36.70 [27.22] versus 21.27 [25.92]), overall work impairment (40.87 [28.83] versus 23.33 [27.28]), and impairment of non-work-related daily activities (34.89 [26.04] versus 21.36 [24.88]; P < 0.001 for all comparisons).

Discussion

The nationally representative nature of the study population in the present manuscript allowed us to more accurately estimate the prevalence of chronic cough and characterize the demographics of chronic cough among Chinese adults. This study estimated that 4.1% of adults in mainland China (~ 27.2 million people) have experienced chronic cough during the prior 12 months, and 7.0% (~ 46.4 million) during their lifetime. The prevalence of chronic cough was similar among men and women. Compared to matched controls, significantly higher proportions of adults reporting chronic cough in the prior 12 months had experienced respiratory, sleep-related, and other conditions; the chronic cough group also had significantly more comorbidities. Respondents with chronic cough also had a lower health-related quality of life, worse depression and anxiety, more impairment of work and other activities, and higher rates of all-cause health care resource use.

The estimated 4.1% weighted annual prevalence of chronic cough was lower than the estimated overall prevalence reported by a recent meta-analysis, which was 8.8% among studies that defined chronic cough as daily cough for > 8 weeks [35]. However, most of the included studies had small sample sizes and a low-to-moderate grade of evidence [35]. The current study population was larger and more nationally representative than that of most of the studies included in the prior analysis, and prevalence was weighted to the national population to minimize sampling bias. Further, the estimated weighted annual prevalence was lower than the estimated three-year average probability (8.9%) reported from an administrative claims database study among Chinese adults from nine cities in 2015, 2016, and 2017 [50]. However, the prevalence estimated herein is also broadly similar to the findings of equivalent studies that analyzed NHWS data from other countries, which reported a weighted annual prevalence that ranged from 4.3% in Japan and South Korea to 6.3% in Italy and a lifetime prevalence that ranged from 6.2% in South Korea and the UK to 9.2% in Italy (Table 1) [11, 12, 15, 34, 36–39].

The nationally representative nature of the study population also allowed us to characterize the demographics of chronic cough among Chinese adults. Globally, chronic cough is generally associated with older age, with a peak prevalence at ≥ 50 years of age [51, 52]. In the current study, the numerically highest prevalence of chronic cough was observed among individuals 30–39 and ≥ 75 years of age, and the mean age of 43.5 years among individuals with chronic cough was lower than in studies that used NHWS data from other countries (US, 50.1 years; Germany, 52.1 years) [12, 15]. Studies of the demographics of chronic cough in China have identified some interesting potential differences compared to other national populations. Our findings are consistent with previous reports that Chinese populations with chronic cough are younger than equivalent populations from other countries, and that there may be a peak prevalence of chronic cough during middle age in China [8, 22, 51, 52]. However, in a study that surveyed a nationally representative sample of approximately 51,000 Chinese adults, Huang et al. reported a mean age of 52.0 years among a group of 1,985 individuals with chronic cough, which is more consistent with the demographics of the condition in Western nations [5]. The use of different definitions of chronic cough (≥ 8 weeks in the current study versus ≥ 3 months in Huang et al.; the latter definition was based on that of chronic bronchitis) may explain this discrepancy, highlighting the importance of consistent definitions of chronic cough.

Further, studies in other countries have consistently found that chronic cough is strongly associated with female sex, potentially due to a more sensitive cough reflex among women [11, 12, 15, 26, 31, 51–57]. However, as comprehensively reviewed by Bai et al. [51], almost all studies that have reported the sex distribution of chronic cough in Chinese populations have identified either a weaker female preponderance than is seen in most studies from other countries, a roughly equal prevalence among men and women, or even a slight male preponderance [5, 10, 17–19, 22, 24, 26, 27, 58]. Our finding that men and women had a similar prevalence of chronic cough may be explained by the higher prevalence of smoking among men compared to women. In an additional analysis, we found that the proportion of current and former smokers was five times higher among men than women. However, the prevalence of chronic cough among male smokers was lower than that among female smokers. Among never smokers, we found no difference in the prevalence between men and women (data not shown). Smoking could be an effect modifier which at least partially contributed to the observed sex differences in China compared to the global pattern of a strong female preponderance [5, 8, 10–12, 17–19, 22, 24, 39, 51, 52, 58]. The smoking distribution in additional analyses varied by age and sex, suggesting that the overall demographics of chronic cough in China may be due to a higher prevalence of the condition among younger men than is seen elsewhere in the world [8, 22, 51]. Our analysis thus contributes further evidence that the sex distribution of chronic cough in China differs from that observed in many Western nations.

Our study confirms previous reports from China and other countries that chronic cough is more common among individuals with a history of smoking cigarettes [5, 11, 12, 15, 20, 22, 23]. However, more than half (57.7%) of the current study population who reported experiencing chronic cough had never smoked, which is consistent with other reports from China [5, 8, 22]. It has previously been suggested that the distinct demographics of chronic cough in China may be driven at least partially by cigarette smoking, since Chinese men (and particularly young men) have one of the highest rates of cigarette smoking in the world while Chinese women have one of the lowest [8, 22, 51, 59, 60]. However, our findings are consistent with previous reports suggesting that other factors are also involved. For example, in the current study, chronic cough was significantly associated with lower-coverage forms of health insurance (i.e., Urban Resident rather than Urban Employee insurance), which may reflect lower socioeconomic status and less access to health care [61]. Air pollution and occupational or residential exposures, which were not assessed in the current study, have also been suggested as potential risk factors for chronic cough in China, which has one of the highest levels of air pollution in the world; however, the relationship between these variables and chronic cough remains poorly understood [16, 21, 29, 51, 62–64].

Our study comprehensively assessed the health-related characteristics and outcomes of adults with chronic cough. Adults with chronic cough had significantly worse health and health-related outcomes than matched controls, and higher proportions of this group had experienced health-related impairment of sleep, work, and other daily activities. They also reported more frequent use of a range of specialty and non-specialty health care resources. These findings add to the body of evidence that chronic cough represents a serious health burden in China in terms of physical and mental health, quality of life, work productivity, and health care resource use [5, 9, 10, 22, 29]. Our results are supported by a retrospective observational study of a nationwide claims database in China, which concluded that chronic cough is common among medical insurance users, leading to substantial utilization of medical resources and posing a significant burden on healthcare in China [50].

This study used validated instruments to comprehensively survey a large, nationally representative sample of the adult population of mainland China. Our matching strategy rigorously compared adults who had experienced chronic cough within the prior 12 months to a control group of survey respondents who had not. The assessment of a general population sample rather than the specialist samples (e.g., cough clinic attendees) included in many previous Chinese studies allowed us to generate a broader analysis of the characteristics of people living with chronic cough in China and of the national health-related burden of the disease for individuals and the health care system. Our findings bolster the existing literature reporting a distinct demographic pattern in China that merits further study.

However, this study is also subject to some known limitations. Although we used a sampling and weighting strategy designed to minimize sampling bias, some degree of sampling bias may remain, which may affect the accuracy of the weighted prevalence estimates for the full national population. The NHWS likely under-represents people without access to or comfort with online surveys, including less healthy older adults, institutionalized individuals, and individuals with severe health conditions or disabilities. Study measures were self-reported and may be subject to recall and other biases; to mitigate these issues, the survey questions focused on recent timeframes (e.g., prior week or month) when possible and the list of answers to potentially sensitive questions included “don’t know” and “prefer not to answer” options. Further, the data presented in this study are derived from the 2020 fielding of the NHWS, which was administered during the earliest stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As research on the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to evolve, its impact on the prevalence of chronic cough remains uncertain [65, 66]. However, we believe the impact of the pandemic was minimal as strict lockdown measures implemented across the country likely limited exposure to respiratory infections and environmental triggers.

Conclusions

In conclusion, chronic cough affects approximately 27.2 million adults per year in China and is associated with worse health, worse health-related quality of life, work productivity loss, impairment of daily activities, and increased all-cause health care resource use. Our findings are consistent with those of many previous Chinese studies and add to the literature on the characteristics of the general population living with chronic cough. Improved treatment options are needed to reduce the individual and health care system burden of the disease.

肺癌的死亡率在全世界范围内一直居所有恶性肿瘤之首[1,⇓-3]。近年来，随着低剂量螺旋计算机断层扫描（low dose spiral computed tomography, LDCT）的广泛应用及定期体检的普及，越来越多的肺结节患者被检出，其中部分患者需要接受手术治疗。咳嗽是肺部手术后最常见的并发症之一，术后急性咳嗽控制不佳将转变为慢性咳嗽。文献[4,⇓,⇓-7]报道，肺部手术后慢性咳嗽发生率在25%-50%之间。慢性咳嗽会加剧患者术后切口的疼痛，使其怀疑治疗效果，甚至会导致部分患者出现抑郁症状，严重影响术后生活质量[8]。因此，研究肺部手术后慢性咳嗽发生规律，并在围手术期给予适当干预，减少其发生率并改善患者症状，是临床亟待解决的问题之一。目前，国内外文献对肺部手术后慢性咳嗽危险因素相关性分析较少，未有报道关于肺部手术后慢性咳嗽模型建立。因此，本研究旨在构建肺部术后慢性咳嗽的临床预测模型，以期为肺部手术患者围手术期预防和管理提供支持，减少肺部术后慢性咳嗽的发生率。

1 资料与方法
1.1 研究对象

回顾性分析2021年1月至2023年6月于中国科学技术大学附属第一医院接受单孔胸腔镜肺部切除术的499例患者临床资料和术后咳嗽情况，按7:3随机分配原则分为训练集（n=348）和验证集（n=151）。纳入标准：（1）接受单孔胸腔镜肺叶切除术或亚肺叶切除术；（2）组织病理学证实为周围型非小细胞肺癌；（3）R0切除；（4）无新辅助治疗；（5）签署知情同意书。排除标准：（1）术前存在呼吸道感染性疾病，如咽炎、过敏性鼻炎、慢性阻塞性肺疾病（chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD）、支气管哮喘、鼻后滴流综合征等；（2）手术中转开放手术；（3）中央型肺癌或接受袖式切除或气管重建手术；（4）术后出现严重并发症，包括肺部感染、明显神经损伤、肺栓塞、乳糜胸等；（5）失访或病例资料不完整。本研究经中国科学技术大学附属第一医院伦理审查委员会批准（2023-RE-379）。

1.2 研究方法

收集受试者性别、年龄、吸烟史、高血压史、糖尿病史、术前肺功能指标、肿瘤部位、肿瘤最大径、手术麻醉时间、术中是否双腔管插管、胸腔是否粘连、手术左右侧、手术方式、是否位于上叶、淋巴结清扫方式、上纵隔淋巴结清扫情况、下纵隔淋巴结清扫情况、术后胸引管带管时间。其中淋巴结清扫方式主要包括选择性淋巴结采样和系统性淋巴结清扫。选择性淋巴结采样对手术中可疑转移的淋巴结进行采样活检；系统性淋巴结清扫指系统性清除解剖标志内包含淋巴结在内的所有纵隔组织，要求最少切除3站纵隔淋巴结，并且其中必须包括隆突下淋巴结，除纵隔淋巴结以外，肺门和肺内淋巴结必须一并切除[9]。

通过电话随访调查问卷的方式比较两组患者肺术后慢性咳嗽情况及生活质量情况。本研究使用中文版本的莱斯特咳嗽量表[10]（Mandarin-Chinese version of the Leicester cough questionnaire, LCQ-MC）评估患者咳嗽严重程度及对生活质量的影响，LCQ-MC分为生理、心理和社会3个维度，一共19道题，包括8项生理项目、7项心理项目和4项社会项目，每道题7个选项（正向计分，1-7个等级，分数越高表示咳嗽程度越轻）。各维度的得分由各维度题目分值取平均值（1-7分），总分为3个维度得分之和（3-21分）。本研究中的499例患者均在2位经过培训的医务人员的指导下，分别于手术前1天、术后8周完成LCQ-MC。根据训练集患者术后8周是否合并慢性咳嗽将其分为发生咳嗽组（n=94）及非咳嗽组（n=254）。

1.3 咳嗽评价方法

术后慢性咳嗽采用咳嗽视觉模拟量表（visual analog scale, VAS）和自拟的数字评分法（numerical rating scale, NRS）共同评估。VAS是一种线性评分方法，使用0-100的刻度线，0表示没有咳嗽，100表示最严重的咳嗽，要求患者根据自己对咳嗽的知觉在刻度线上标记咳嗽的严重程度，并且以测量起始点到标记点的距离作为评分，分数越高，咳嗽越严重。NRS评价患者的咳嗽程度（0分：无咳嗽；1-3分：轻度咳嗽，对睡眠无影响；4-6分：中度咳嗽，对睡眠有影响，但能入睡；7-9分：重度咳嗽，无法入睡或睡眠中咳醒；10分：剧烈咳嗽）。当VAS刻度线达到60 mm且NRS评分达到4分时，可将该患者纳入术后慢性咳嗽组；当VAS评分或NRS评分只满足一项或者两项都未达到时纳入非咳嗽组。

1.4 统计学分析

应用SPSS 26.0进行数据分析，P<0.05为差异有统计学意义。应用卡方检验、t检验与秩和检验比较两组患者临床病例资料，应用单因素二元Logistic回归分析评估肺部手术后慢性咳嗽的相关性，仅对训练集中单因素分析有统计学意义的因素，进一步纳入多因素二元Logistic回归分析，以寻找独立危险因素（包括临床因素、术中因素、术后因素）。将最终独立危险因素引入R软件（The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria）4.3.2版，采用“pROC”进行受试者工作特征（receiver operator characteristic, ROC）曲线分析。Nomogram用“rms”完成，决策曲线分析（decision curve analysis, DCA）用“rmda”完成。曲线下面积（area under the curve, AUC）均采用自举偏差校正的95%CI。同时建立ROC，采用AUC评估此模型；为了评估Nomogram的临床应用价值，使用临床校准曲线展示预测数据和实际数据之间拟合情况；通过计算一系列阈值概率的净收益，将数据集进行DCA分析。

2.4 列线图模型构建

3 讨论

肺部手术后咳嗽是最常见且难治的并发症之一，控制不佳将转变为慢性咳嗽[11]。美国胸科学会对慢性咳嗽定义为：咳嗽为唯一或者首要症状且持续时间超过8周，并且无肺部疾病的影像学证据[12]。术后慢性咳嗽症状会增加患者焦虑情绪，不可避免地产生心理和生理创伤，严重影响患者术后的生活质量。术后慢性咳嗽受到临床内外持续关注，对于引发肺术后慢性咳嗽的危险因素进行探索并在术中超前干预及采取合理防治措施是患者良好预后的关键；术后慢性咳嗽可能与手术因素[13]、肺容量损失继发病变[14]、麻醉因素[15]和其他因素相关。本研究通过构建肺部手术后慢性咳嗽模型，为术中临床决策及术后管理提供支持，有效减少肺部手术后慢性咳嗽发生，提高患者术后生活质量。

肺部手术后慢性咳嗽的机制目前研究较少，且存在一定争议。既往研究[16]表明纵隔淋巴结清扫是肺部手术后慢性咳嗽的重要危险因素，特别是上纵隔淋巴结清扫与隆突下淋巴结清扫对肺部手术后慢性咳嗽的影响；我们研究发现行上纵隔淋巴结清扫与隆突下淋巴结清扫肺部手术后慢性咳嗽的发生率更高。Mu等[17]回顾性分析901例肺切除患者的术后持续咳嗽的特征，结果显示纵隔淋巴结清扫是肺部手术后持续性咳嗽的独立危险因素。对于上纵隔淋巴结清扫与隆突下淋巴结清扫可能加重术后慢性咳嗽的机制，我们分析可能与以下原因相关：（1）术中在清扫隆突下淋巴结会留下一个残腔，导致肺部快速适应性牵张感受器暴露在外，术后患者下床活动引起的机械性刺激和胸腔积液引起的化学性刺激就会兴奋这些感受器，通过迷走神经的传递引起咳嗽反射，从而引起术后咳嗽的发生；（2）肺术后持续性咳嗽很大程度上是由于神经C纤维的刺激引起的[18]，而肺部咳嗽的70%-80%的感觉神经纤维是由神经C纤维构成的，术中电刀、超声刀等能量器械进行操作时会损伤位于相应位置迷走神经传入纤维和气管壁导致咳嗽传入纤维敏感性增加和气管壁内的咳嗽感受器异常兴奋从而加重术后咳嗽；（3）隆突下淋巴结的清扫会引起周围气道和相邻肺组织发生炎症反应，通过多种途径释放如缓激肽（bradykinin, BK）和前列腺素E2（prostaglandin E2, PGE2）等炎症因子，在此基础上激活瞬时受体电位通道香草醛亚型1（transient receptor potential channel vanillin subtype 1, TRPV1）通路[19]，从而通过不同的途径诱发术后咳嗽。另外，不同手术方式同样影响着肺部手术后慢性咳嗽的发生率，Chen等[6]研究表明，行双腔导管麻醉下肺大疱切除术3个月后，咳嗽的概率约为50%，肺段切除术和肺叶切除术约为60%，由此可见肺段及肺叶切除术较楔形切除术更容易发生术后咳嗽，我们的研究结果与此类似，我们分析原因为：（1）这与离断患者的断支气管角度过长与角度扭曲有关，会激活肺组织内巨噬细胞产生炎症反应，从而诱发咳嗽的发生；（2）肺段切除及肺叶切除更容易损伤段支气管旁局部神经纤维，导致咳嗽相关神经元通路受损，引起术后慢性咳嗽。

近年来，研究[20,21]发现术前肺功能训练可以预防肺部手术后咳嗽的发生。Hasanpour等[20]通过对81例COPD患者进行多模式的肺部呼吸功能训练，结果显示训练组3个月后FEV1/FVC有明显的改善，显著减少COPD患者的咳嗽喘息方面的症状。我们研究发现患者肺功能差、手术前FEV1/FVC越低，术后慢性咳嗽发生率越高。我们分析可能原因有：（1）咳嗽作为人体的一种保护性呼吸反射动作，FEV1/FVC越低，提示小气道通气功能越差，当肺部手术后肺容积缩小时，会主动咳嗽，促进肺复张。（2）肺功能较差患者呼吸道防御保护作用下降，对于肺部手术后残端更容易形成局部炎症，炎症过程酸性物质的积累和气道pH值的变化可刺激相应位置的咳嗽感受器，通过一系列神经传递引起咳嗽反射的发生，从而加重术后咳嗽。目前，关于胸腔闭式引流时间对肺部术后慢性咳嗽研究较少；我们研究发现术后胸腔闭式引流时间越长，患者术后慢性咳嗽发生率越高，生活质量越低。Huang等[21]通过观察行肺癌根治+纵隔淋巴结切除术的100例患者，发现脂肪填充组在拔出胸引管4周后，患者的夜间咳嗽明显改善。我们分析原因可能是：（1）胸腔闭式引流管对胸膜的刺激，可导致患者呼吸肌肌力下降、肺容量减少，使得分泌物滞留呼吸道，导致术后慢性咳嗽的发生；（2）引流管留置时间延长及术后切口疼痛感愈强通常限制术后早期的身体活动，胸管可以促进胸腔积液的引流和胸腔减压，无论是机制牵引还是胸腔积液都不会过度刺激咳嗽受体；当置管时间延长，胸腔积液减少，负压增加时反而刺激咳嗽受体，导致咳嗽的发生。

列线图是一种用于临床事件个体化预测分析的统计学模型，与其他预测性统计学方法相比，列线图分析可以通过直观且可视化的方式提供更好的个体化预后风险评估。本研究将多因素Logistic回归分析中的独立危险因素对肺部术后慢性咳嗽影响的权重绘制Nomogram模型，对每个变量不同水平进行打分，总分越高的患者肺部术后发生慢性咳嗽的风险越大。经验证显示模型区分度良好，其预测值与观察值校准度良好，同时患者的临床获益可观。临床工作中根据此模型可以精准地预测肺部术后慢性咳嗽的发生，术前肺功能训练、术中超前干预及术后合理防治将有效减少术后慢性咳嗽的发生。

综上所述，基于患者的术前FEV1/FVC、手术方式、行上纵隔淋巴结清扫、行隆突下淋巴结清扫、术后胸腔闭式引流时间制作的肺部术后慢性咳嗽列线图精准地预测了术后慢性咳嗽的发生，术前、术中和术后有针对性的干预是减少术后慢性咳嗽的有效途径，列线图预测模型是减少术后慢性咳嗽的有效工具。由于本研究是单中心回顾性研究，这些结果可能会受到选择偏倚的影响，进一步的研究应该为前瞻性且多中心入组更多的患者，以便更好地验证肺部切除术后慢性咳嗽预测模型。

Abstract
Background

Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHHR), a new biomarker, reflects blood lipid status. Nevertheless, the association between NHHR and chronic cough remains uncertain.

Method

This investigation included 9725 individuals from the NHANES. This research employed multiple statistical models to illustrate the association between NHHR and chronic cough. These models included logistic regression models, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) model, trend tests, mediation analysis, restricted cubic splines (RCS), and subgroup analyses.

Result

The logistic regression model, adjusting all covariables, showed a positive association between NHHR with chronic cough (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.02–1.14). Trend tests and RCS further proved that NHHR and chronic cough had a linear and positive association. The mediation analysis proved that systemic immune inflammation index (SII) and systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) partially mediated the association between NHHR and chronic cough. The SHAP model suggested that the top five important markers for predicting chronic cough were SII, smoking, NHHR, BMI, and SIRI.

Conclusion

This investigation discovered that NHHR was positively associated with chronic cough. Regular NHHR monitoring may serve as a potential tool for identifying individuals at higher risk of chronic cough.

Introduction

Chronic cough is a frequent presentation in respiratory clinics and often signifies underlying respiratory or non-respiratory conditions. While it was previously defined epidemiologically as a cough persisting for more than three months, current clinical guidelines classify it as a cough lasting longer than eight weeks as the primary symptom [1, 2]. A retrospective meta-analysis reported that the prevalence of chronic cough around the world has been estimated to vary from 2 to 18% in diverse geographical regions [3]. If left untreated and unresolved, prolonged coughing can trigger a variety of detrimental effects on both the physical and psychological well-being of individuals, ultimately diminishing quality of life [4–6]. Aside from that, chronic cough is often seen merely as a symptom rather than a standalone clinical condition, it can lessen the diagnosis precision. For this reason, individuals suffering from chronic cough are likely to experience an elevated economic burden, predominantly encompassing direct costs such as medical consultations, medications, diagnosis, and hospitalization, as well as indirect costs including lowered productivity and absenteeism [7–9].

Notwithstanding the paucity of clinical research exploring the link between dyslipidemia and chronic cough, multiple studies have delved into the sophisticated connection between lipid metabolism and inflammatory lung disease. The risk of respiratory conditions may be exacerbated by dyslipidemia through inflammatory responses and oxidative stress [10]. As previously illustrated, variations in lipid metabolism may contribute to the development and advancement of COPD [11]. A 10-year follow-up retrospective cohort study revealed that individuals with hyperlipidemia had a 1.48-fold increased risk of developing COPD compared to those without it [12]. An inverse link between asthma incidence and levels of serum cholesterol as well as non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (NHDL-C) was found after serum cholesterol measurements were analyzed in 7,005 participants by Michael et al. Conversely, no statistically significant association was observed between asthma and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels [13]. Nonetheless, a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study arrived at an utterly dissimilar conclusion that the elevated LDL is casually bound up with cholesterol levels, lowered HDL levels and heightened risk of asthma [14].

The non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHHR), a novel composite index, serves as an effective measure of atherogenic lipid profiles. Previous studies have demonstrated that NHHR outperforms conventional lipid parameters in predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome [15–17].

Given its established utility, investigating the relationship between NHHR and chronic cough may offer valuable insights into the interplay between lipid metabolism and lung diseases. Studies have highlighted the potential role of systemic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation in the pathogenesis of chronic cough [9, 18]. Inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of chronic cough, including local airway inflammation, systemic inflammation, and inflammation-mediated cough hypersensitivity [19, 20]. Interestingly, earlier studies have reported an inverse association between NHHR levels and asthma prevalence, while a positive association has been observed with COPD risk. However, the potential link between NHHR and chronic cough remains underexplored. To address this gap, this study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to examine the association between NHHR and chronic cough.

Materials and methods
Study population

The purpose of NHANES is to provide policymakers with nutritional and medical information on American adults and children. It is freely available to the public and updated frequently. The data analyzed of the investigation originated from the 2007–2012 NHANES. Exclusion criteria included: [1] those missing chronic cough data; [2] people with either HDL-C or NHDL-C missing; and [3] people with missing covariables. In the end, 9725 individuals were assigned to this investigation. The analyzed populations’ screening process diagram was apparent in Fig. 1.

Assessment of NHHR and chronic cough

The University of Minnesota received the prepared and preserved blood samples for examination. Blood HDL-C and total blood cholesterol concentrations were quantified using enzymatic techniques. NHHR = (Total cholesterol - HDL-C) / HDL-C. This study determined whether the subjects had a chronic or non-chronic cough using the standard questionnaire. A physician or other health care provider asked the participant, “Do you often experience a cough on most days for a duration of three continuous months or longer each year?” When the participant responded “yes,” the participant was determined to have a chronic cough.

Covariables

Some covariables were incorporated into the investigation to reduce the potential effect caused by confounding factors. This study included the following confounding factors: sex, race, age, smoking, alcohol, education, marriage, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disorder (CVD), asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, cancer, systemic immune inflammation index (SII = platelet number * neutrophil number/lymphocyte number), and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI = monocyte number * neutrophil number/lymphocyte number) [21].

Statistical analysis

This investigation applied the chi-square test to acquire the P-value for categorical data and the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test to acquire the P-value for continuous data. For non-normally distributed continuous data, this investigation utilized the median and IQR, whereas for those with normal distribution, this investigation employed the mean and SE. Percentages were implemented to describe categorical data. This investigation initially adopted three logistic regression analyses and trend tests to assess the relationship between NHHR and chronic cough. Restrictive cubic splines (RCS), based on logistic regression models, were employed to better quantify the dose-response association between NHHR and chronic cough. Subsequently, this investigation implemented the mediation effect model to assess the contribution of systematic inflammation to the association between NHHR and chronic cough. Afterwards, this study used the SHAP model with XGBoost to determine the importance of each variable identifying associations with chronic cough. Ultimately, this research performed subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses using data derived from multiple imputations. This survey applied “MICE” package to handle the lack of covariables (education, marriage, BMI, smoking, alcohol, hypertension, diabetes, CVD, asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, cancer, SII, and SIRI) with multiple imputations, and the percentage of each missing covariables was below 10%. Version 4.4.1 of R was employed to conduct all statistical analyses. This study defined statistical significance as P-value < 0.05.

Results
Baseline characteristic

The basic characteristic of the studied populations were summed up in Table 1. The average age of 9725 persons in this study was 59.60 years, and 1065 of them had a chronic cough. In the comparison of people without chronic cough versus people with chronic cough, several variables exhibited statistically significant differences, such as race, age, education, marriage, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, CVD, asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, cancer, SII, SIRI, and NHHR.

Association between NHHR and chronic cough

This research also employed three logistic regressions to quantify the association between NHHR with chronic cough (Table 2). Higher NHHR was associated with increased odds of chronic cough, as demonstrated by Models A, B, and C. And Model C showed the odds of chronic cough increased by 8% for each additional unit of NHHR, adjusting for all covariates. The results of the trend test (Table 2) indicated that the NHHR group with the highest tertile (T3) had an increased likelihood of chronic cough compared to the NHHR group with the lowest tertile (T1). The P for trend = 0.0216 indicated statistical significance in the trend test and suggested a linear association between NHHR and chronic cough. Subsequently, this study further confirmed the linear association between NHHR and chronic cough using RCS (P-non-linear = 0.160) (Fig. 2). Mediation analysis proved that SII (1.62%) and SIRI (2.97%) partially mediated the association between NHHR and the probability of chronic cough (Figure S1).

SHAP Model

Moreover, this study also used SHAP based on the XGBoost model to evaluate the contribution and importance of each variable (sex, age, race, education, marriage, BMI, smoking, alcohol, hypertension, diabetes, CVD, asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, cancer, SII, SIRI, and NHHR) in predicting chronic cough. The SHAP model indicated that the top five variables that contributed the most to predicting chronic cough were SII, smoking, NHHR, BMI, and SIRI (Fig. 3A). Among them, NHHR was positively associated with chronic cough (Fig. 3B).

Subgroup and sensitivity analysis

Subgroup analyses were carried out to discuss the association between NHHR with chronic cough in various groups (Table S1). White women over 60 years old, without asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema, exhibited the positive association between elevated NHHR with probability of chronic cough. This investigation also conducted several sensitivity analyses to prove the dependability and accuracy of previous outcomes. After the multiple imputation of all missing covariables, the primary results obtained from the imputed data were predominantly consistent with previous outcomes (Table S2 and Figure S2).

Discussion

Novel insights into the associations between NHHR and the probability of chronic cough were provided by our study. Multiple statistical models were employed in this study, revealing that the probability of chronic cough increased as NHHR levels rose. Mediation analysis proved that SII and SIRI partially mediated the association between NHHR and chronic cough. As evidently suggested by the SHAP model, SII, smoking, NHHR, BMI, and SIRI were identified as the top five key predictors for the probability of chronic cough.

The notion that NHHR is a superior indicator of lipid-relevant disease risk is strongly supported by mushrooming evidence. Although rare studies have directly dug into the possible link between a chronic cough and lipid metabolism for the time being, multitudinous studies have suggested that problems with regard to lipid metabolism can worsen respiratory diseases like COPD, asthma, and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [22]. In general, respiratory disorders are featured by airflow limitation and chronic airway inflammation. What’s more, inflammation presents a profound association with disorders of lipid metabolism [23]. As apparently demonstrated by current theory, high levels of plasma free fatty acids (FFA) and LDL-C can transform into oxidized LDL, which damages lung tissues even more by causing oxidative stress and apoptosis for more damage [24]. And evidence suggests that oxidative stress may be a key factor in triggering the vicious cycle of chronic cough [25]. Airway wall thickening and airflow limitation can be precipitated by aberrant lipid accumulation within the airways, thereby exacerbating the risk of airway injury in parallel [26]. As displayed by a 5-year follow-up prospective cohort study, an augment of 100 mg in triglyceride levels revealed a certain link with a 42% elevation in mortality rates among COPD patients [27]. Another nationwide population study in Taiwan has demonstrated a 1.48-fold elevated risk of COPD in individuals suffering from hyperlipidaemia in comparison with those without hyperlipidaemia [12]. A potential association between asthma and dyslipidemia, especially with elevated triglyceride levels, is being pointed out by accumulating evidence. As clearly suggested by an exploratory study, dyslipidemia contributes to the pathogenesis of asthma. An independent association between elevated serum triglyceride levels and asthma in obese patients was reported accordingly [28]. It’ s noteworthy that a link between composite biomarkers, such as the monocyte-to-HDL cholesterol ratio and the triglyceride-glucose index, has been shown by cross-sectional studies [29, 30]. The problem of lipid indices not fully describing fat utilization in organisms and the asthma patient population has been addressed by these studies. More recent retrospective analyses have unveiled a positive link between elevated levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL-C being associated with the development of asthma [31]. As indicated by an all-round review of the literature on sepsis, plasma cholesterol is a paramount factor in severe bacterial infections [32]. On top of that, within the field of sepsis research, evidence in an increasing amount underscores the vital importance of plasma cholesterol in severe bacterial infections. A modest-scale investigation exhibits a major finding that hypocholesterolemia is linked with augmented mortality from severe CAP [33].

Respiratory conditions, such as chronic bronchitis (a type of COPD), asthma, and pathogenic infections, are widely recognized as common causes of chronic cough [34]. While numerous studies have suggested a potential link between dyslipidemia and respiratory conditions, evidence remains limited. To date, only a small number of studies have directly explored the association between chronic cough and dyslipidemia. The study’s findings, which delved into the lipid profiles of individuals with chronic cough, indicated that no statistically significant differences were found in cholesterol, triglyceride, VLDL, and HDL values when the patient group and the control group were compared systematically [35]. Nevertheless, our exploration suggested that NHHR displayed positive connection with an augmented prevalence of chronic cough.

NHHR stands for a new marker of blood lipid status. As evidently illustrated by a multiplying number of studies, NHHR can independently throw light upon the risk of lipid-relevant diseases in adults, including Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, kidney stones, diabetes, and suicidal thoughts [36–39]. It has been proven true even when accounting for errors in LDL and HDL levels. A negative association between NHHR and asthma incidence was demonstrated among American people, with gender influences being noted [40]. We also observed that DII-mediated, higher NHHR levels can bring about an augment in COPD prevalence [41]. It’s noteworthy that a linear positive association between NHHR and chronic cough was found in our investigation, which aligns with the conclusions drawn from their studies. As a result, NHHR serves as a valuable tool for predicting the likelihood of chronic cough. Altogether, excellent predictive efficacy has been demonstrated by the NHHR in a range of studies. Furthermore, distinguished by its non-invasive nature, ease of accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, the NHHR therefore has been extensively utilized, which adequately exhibits exceptional potential for clinical implementation.

Notwithstanding the fact that the link between NHHR and chronic cough through various statistical models, some limitations still exist in our survey. First and foremost, the diagnosis of chronic cough in NHANES is based on standard medical questionnaires rather than international diagnostic criteria, and some people lost questionnaire information, which may cause some bias. And due to database limitations, this survey did not include information on other potential chronic cough diseases, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease and interstitial lung disease. Secondly, we failed to prove causation as much attributable to the study’s cross-sectional approach. It’s exceedingly pivotal to carry out longitudinal studies, so as to confirm the causal link between NHHR and chronic cough. In addition, despite the adjustment for a wide range of covariables, the limitation inherent in NHANES data prevents the exclusion of potential confounders arising from unmeasured variables, such as dietary factors or occupational exposures. Last, certain drugs that affect chronic cough may have been excluded from the study population ascribed to the limitations of the NHANES database. Further studies incorporating clinical evaluations are needed to validate our results.

Conclusion

This study discovered that NHHR was positively associated with chronic cough. SII and SIRI partially mediated the association between NHHR and chronic cough. NHHR may be a valuable biomarker for predicting chronic cough. Regular NHHR monitoring may serve as a potential tool for identifying individuals at higher risk of chronic cough.

Abstract
Background:

Cough hypersensitivity is an important part of the neurophysiology of cough, which presents with increased cough response to a lower level of stimuli or triggers. Classification of stimuli might bring about additional insight into the underlying mechanisms and management.

Objectives:

This study investigated the profile of cough triggers in chronic cough patients and their relationship with capsaicin cough sensitivity.

Design:

This was a cross-sectional observational study.

Methods:

We enrolled patients with different causes of chronic cough from 2006 to 2021. Cough triggers were defined as cough response to chemical triggers, mechanical triggers, meal triggers, or thermal trigger. Cough sensitivity to capsaicin was evaluated by the capsaicin challenge test, which was expressed as the lowest concentration of capsaicin inducing 5 or more coughing (C5).

Results:

Among 1211 patients with chronic cough, 1107 (91.4%) patients reported at least one cough trigger. Chemical triggers (66.9%) were the most common cough triggers, followed by thermal exposure (50.6%), mechanical triggers (48.2%), and meal triggers (21.2%). There was no difference in the proportion of chemical triggers among different etiologies. Patients with refractory chronic cough reported the highest prevalence of cough triggers (97.1%). A higher number of meal triggers (34.9%) was associated with gastroesophageal reflux-related cough, and meal triggers and mechanical triggers were more common in refractory chronic cough. Among 254 patients who completed capsaicin challenge test, both the number of total triggers and the number of chemical triggers had a significant but mild correlation with capsaicin cough sensitivity.

Conclusion:

Cough hypersensitivity as reflected by a variety of cough triggers is a common feature in chronic cough patients, but different etiologies present specific profiles of cough triggers, which could not be evaluated comprehensively by capsaicin cough sensitivity.

Keywords: capsaicin cough sensitivity, chronic cough, cough hypersensitivity, cough trigger, refractory chronic cough

Introduction

Chronic cough (CC), defined as a cough lasting longer than 8 weeks, 1 is a frequent condition in general practitioners’ and respiratory specialists’ clinics. It could cause severe impairment of quality of life, limitation of activities, and depression. 2

Cough hypersensitivity is an important part of the neurophysiology of cough, presented with enhanced cough in response to endogenous and exogenous stimuli. This heightened cough sensitivity was observed in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions. 2 To assess the sensitivity of the cough, challenges with inhaled cough-provoking stimuli such as capsaicin, citric acid, or allyl isothiocyanate are exploited,3–5 among which capsaicin is the most widely used chemical but has its limitations. Although the average sensitivity to capsaicin is increased in CC than in healthy control, there is substantial overlap in the data distributions between these two groups. 6 What’s more, capsaicin is a selective agonist of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) while cough hypersensitivity is associated with central and/or peripheral hypersensitivity, 2 which deprives capsaicin challenge test of reflecting completely the cough sensitivity. Thus, additional tools to assess cough sensitivity are needed.

It has been widely accepted that an exaggerated cough response to daily cough triggers is another sign of cough hypersensitivity. Previous studies found that cough hypersensitivity among different causes seems to be slightly different, indicated by various responsiveness to stimuli. Cough response to ‘cold air’ is associated with a diagnosis of asthma,7,8 and unexplained CC presents a higher number of positive responses to cough triggers. 9 Nonetheless, these results were derived from studies with either inaccurate diagnoses based on symptoms or small sample sizes. Therefore, a comprehensive description of cough response to cough triggers in CC patients with different etiologies is necessary.

Recently, cough hypersensitivity syndrome has been redefined as a disorder characterized by troublesome coughing that is often triggered by low levels of thermal, mechanical, or chemical exposure. 2 A classification of cough triggers can bring about additional insight into the underlying mechanisms and different types of management. However, the definition of different kinds of exposure hasn’t been well defined. In addition, the whole picture of cough hypersensitivity to this newly defined classification of exposure is still poorly understood and warrants validation in different populations.

Therefore, the present study is aimed to investigate the profile of classified triggers in different causes of CC. Besides, we explore the association between cough sensitivity to cough triggers and capsaicin.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional observational study. We recruited the consecutive and unselected CC patients who underwent full investigations and treatment at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from 2006 to 2021 in this study. All these patients with CC had undergone thorough diagnostic and treatment workflow as previously described.1,10,11 A standard questionnaire was used to record demographics, clinical features, cough triggers, laboratory results, response to therapy, follow-up, and final diagnosis for CC patients. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) aged 14 years or more; (2) cough as the sole or predominant symptom lasting for at least 8 weeks; and (3) without overt identifiable abnormalities on chest X-ray. Patients were excluded under the following conditions: (1) without full investigations or loss of follow-up to make a definite diagnosis; and (2) incomplete record of cough triggers.

Cough triggers were classified as chemical triggers, mechanical triggers, thermal trigger, and meal triggers. The definitions of different kinds of triggers are displayed in Table 1. Chemical triggers were a range of irritant environmental chemicals that could cause inflammation or tissue damage, including dust, cigarette smoke, and cooking fumes. Mechanical triggers were defined as factors associated with a change of tension of the larynx or intrathoracic pressure, including talking, exercise, and supine position. Thermal trigger in this study was recorded if cough was induced by cold air. Cough that occurs during meals, within 2 h after meals, or after drinking alcohol was defined as the response to meal triggers.

Cough reflex sensitivity to capsaicin was tested in a subset of patients. These subjects were participants in one of our previous studies investigating the phenotypes of cough hypersensitivity (ClinicallTrials.gov NCTO2591550). 12 Participants exhaled to functional residual capacity and then inhaled through the mouthpiece for 1 s. Each participant inhaled capsaicin solution of increasing concentrations by a single breath in the dosimeter method at 1-minute intervals. Record the frequency of coughs during the first 30 seconds after inhalation. The lowest concentrations of capsaicin that evoked two (C2) or five (C5) coughs were recorded. Cough hypersensitivity to capsaicin was suggested when C5 was 62.5 μmol/L or less.

The reporting of this study conforms to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement. 13

Statistical analyses

Sample size and power were determined by power analysis using PASS (version 15.0, NCSS, LLC.). Data were expressed as frequency (percentage) or median (interquartile range). Shapiro–Wilk test was used to evaluate the normality. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed with one-way ANOVA for normally distributed data, Kruskal–Wallis tests for skewed data, and χ2 tests or Fisher exact tests for proportions data, followed by post hoc tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A logistic regression test was used to identify triggers associated with the corresponding diagnosis. Variables whose p-value <0.1 in univariable models were put into the multivariable model. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted with the method of enter. The Spearman rank correlation test was performed to assess the correlation between the number of cough triggers and capsaicin cough sensitivity. Data were analyzed with SPSS Statistics version 25.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) and R programming language.

Results
Clinical features of patients

A total of 1211 patients were enrolled in the study. The demographic characteristics are shown in Table 2. The median age of all patients was 40.0 (IQR 31.0–52.0) years. The number of females (644, 53.2%) was roughly equal to that of males (567, 46.8%). The median course of the disease was 24.0 (IQR 9.3–82.5) months. Among the 1211 patients, 240 (19.8%) were diagnosed as asthma, 277 (22.9%) as EB, 90 (7.4%) as upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), 189 (15.6%) as gastroesophageal reflex-related cough (GERC), 71 (5.9%) as atopic cough (AC), 206 (17.0%) as RCC, and 138 (11.4%) as other causes. Pharyngeal symptoms were observed in most subjects (85.2%), including tickle in the throat (47.2%), frequent throat clearing (36.3%), pharyngeal foreign body sensation (28.1%), tickle below the throat (26.7%), and mucus adhesion to the throat (24.1%).

The prevalence of cough triggers in different causes of CC

The prevalence of cough triggers in all patients and different causes of CC are shown in Table 2, Figures 1, and 2. A total of 1107 (91.4%) patients reported at least one cough trigger. Regarding the specific triggers, the most common cough triggers were cold air (50.6%), cooking fumes (47.5%), cigarette smoke (44.8%), and dust (39.1%). The least common trigger in this study was alcohol, with 4.6% of patients coughing after they drank alcohol (Figure 1). When cough triggers were categorized as chemical, mechanical, meal, and thermal triggers, chemical triggers were the most frequent triggers for cough, occurring in 66.9% of participants, followed by thermal exposure (50.6%), mechanical triggers (48.2%), and meal triggers (21.2%).

The prevalence of cough triggers was highest among subjects with RCC (200, 97.1%), followed by patients with UACS (85, 94.4%) and GERC (176, 93.1%). Mechanical triggers (110, 58.2%) and meal triggers (66, 34.9%) were most reported in GERC patients, followed by RCC, with the second highest prevalence of mechanical triggers (113, 54.9%), and meal triggers (63, 30.6%). There was no significant difference among different causes of CC in terms of chemical triggers and thermal trigger (Table 2).

The univariate logistic regression analysis investigating cough triggers as risk factors of different causes of CC are shown in Supplemental Table S1. Multivariate analysis showed that a higher number of meal triggers was positively associated with GERC (OR: 1.770, 95% CI: 1.340–2.330, p < 0.001) and RCC (OR: 1.480, 95% CI: 1.120–1.960, p = 0.005) but negatively associated with a diagnosis of asthma (OR: 0.620, 95% CI: 0.430–0.890, p = 0.010) and EB (OR: 0.570, 95% CI: 0.410–0.800, p = 0.001), corrected by age and sex. In addition, RCC patients presented with higher sensitivity to mechanical triggers (OR: 1.230, 95% CI: 1.030–1.480, p = 0.022) in multivariate analysis (Tables 3 and 4 and Supplemental Tables S2 and S3).

Demographic profiles of cough triggers in CC

As is shown in Figure 3, chemical triggers (83.4% versus 75.0%; p < 0.001) and thermal trigger (55.9% versus 47.3%; p = 0.003) were reported more frequently in females than in males. Cough associated with meals was more common in males than in females (25.4% versus 17.5%; p = 0.001). Both the proportions of all triggers and mechanical triggers showed no significant sex difference (p > 0.05). The prevalence of cough triggers in different age groups is presented in Supplemental Figure S1. Age was dichotomized as younger than 50 years versus older than 50 years according to the obvious difference in the prevalence of specific kinds of cough triggers in these two groups. In terms of age, patients older than 50 years were more sensitive to chemical triggers (83.9% versus 77.8%; p = 0.022) but less sensitive to meal triggers (16.4% versus 23.0%; p = 0.014) than those younger than 50 years (Figure 3).

Association between cough triggers and capsaicin cough sensitivity

Among the 235 patients who completed the capsaicin cough challenge test with a single cause of cough, 128 (54.5%) reached C5, exhibiting hypersensitivity to capsaicin. No significant difference was observed in cough sensitivity (log C5 value) between patients with CC of different causes (Table 2). As shown in Supplemental Table S4, female patients showed higher cough sensitivity to capsaicin than male patients (64.1% versus 35.9%, p < 0.001), and patients with heightened cough sensitivity to capsaicin had older age (p = 0.044). Among the 254 patients who completed capsaicin cough challenge test with either single or multiple causes of cough, both the number of all triggers (ρ = −0.201, p = 0.001) and the number of chemical triggers (ρ = −0.263, p < 0.001) had a significant but low correlation with capsaicin cough sensitivity, whereas the number of mechanical triggers (ρ = −0.045, p = 0.475) was not associated with capsaicin cough sensitivity (Figure 4). In addition, patients with at least one trigger showed significantly lower logC5 (1.8 versus 2.4; p = 0.049), indicating higher cough sensitivity (Supplemental Table S5). In the analysis of the correlation between specific triggers and capsaicin cough sensitivity, dust (ρ = −0.213, p = 0.001), cooking fume (ρ = −0.177, p = 0.005) cigarette smoke (ρ = −0.207, p = 0.001) were associated with increased LogC5, while other triggers were not associated with capsaicin cough sensitivity (Supplemental Table S6).

Discussion

The study showed an overall cough hypersensitivity in terms of at least one cough trigger in CC patients in our cohort. Higher sensitivity to mechanical triggers and meal triggers was observed in RCC and meal triggers in GERC. Capsaicin cough sensitivity had a low correlation with cough sensitivity to chemical triggers but was not associated with mechanical triggers. This study, for the first time, roughly classified cough triggers in daily life according to the possible mechanism and investigated their profile in different causes of CC in a large sample size. In addition, the relationship between cough sensitivity to classified cough triggers and capsaicin was also studied, which supported the existence of heterogeneity in cough hypersensitivity.

Cough hypersensitivity, mediated by peripheral and/or central hypersensitivity, is an important part of the neurophysiology of cough. 2 In our study, more than 90.0% of patients reported at least one cough trigger, which also indicated that cough hypersensitivity is a general feature of CC. For neuropathic pain, the classification of allodynia or hyperalgesia according to different types of stimuli can bring about additional insight into the underlying pain mechanisms and different types of management. 14 By analogy with this, we classified cough triggers into chemical triggers, mechanical triggers, meal triggers, and thermal trigger. Chemical-triggers-induced cough is triggered by a range of irritant environmental chemicals and mediators causing airway inflammation or tissue damage, which might be mostly mediated by jugular vagal C-fibers. 15 In this study, cough sensitivity to chemical triggers was similar among all etiologies, and so was capsaicin sensitivity. As the receptor for capsaicin was TRPV1 in vagal pulmonary C-fiber sensory nerves, the analogous response of each etiology to chemical and capsaicin might indicate a common heightened activation of C-fiber in CC. Mechanical triggers, characterized by their responsiveness to touch-like mechanical stimuli and change of tension of the larynx or intrathoracic pressure, were speculated to be primarily associated with nodose vagal afferent Aδ fibers.16,17 RCC was more responsive to mechanical triggers than other causes in this study. Previous studies have also found increased sensitivity to talking, one of the mechanical triggers, in RCC. 9 These findings prompt possible sensitization of Aδ fiber in RCC. However, the value of Aδ fiber activation represented by mechanical triggers for the diagnosis and treatment of RCC needs further study. Meals-induced cough was denoted as factors relating to eating or drinking. Cough sensitivity to meal triggers was elevated in GERC compared to patients with other causes in this study. It was in line with one of our previous studies that cough triggered by meals might indicate GERC. 18 Generally considered, reflux-induced microaspiration or neuronal sensitization of esophageal-bronchial crosstalk account for cough in GERC. On the other hand, we found heightened cough sensitivity to meal triggers in RCC, which was consistent with a previous study. 9 The inclusion of refractory GERC in RCC might be partly responsible for this finding, 19 but more reasons involved remain uncertain. The significance of RCC patients’ hypersensitivity to meal triggers on the diagnosis and treatment of RCC needs further study. Thermal trigger in the present study was referred to as cold air. On one hand, dry air induces a transient change in osmolarity in the epithelial fluid, causing bronchoconstriction and coughing through the activation of mechanical receptors. On the other hand, cold stimuli to the skin and cross-talk of sensory afferents between the skin and airways in the brainstem could mediate cough.20–22 Previous studies showed that cold air was more related to asthma.8,23 However, inconsistent with this, cold air-induced cough did not differ significantly between etiologies in the present study. The discrepancy may be related to the enormously distinct climate where the studies were conducted. Central sensitization is also a key feature of cough hypersensitivity. 2 While central sensitization is understood to increase the responsiveness of neurons to stimuli, how this process specifically interacts with different triggers of cough is not well-defined. A more accurate and comprehensive classification of cough triggers and their prompting value in the diagnosis and treatment of different causes of CC demand further study.

A female and elder predominance in increased cough sensitivity to chemical triggers was observed in this study, which is consistent with higher capsaicin cough sensitivity in older females in previous studies.12,24,25 Higher sensitivity in females might be associated with genetically higher central sensitivity25,26 and enhanced activation of TRPV1 by estrogen hormone. 27 Regardless of sex, increased capsaicin cough sensitivity was observed in the older age group compared with younger patients. 28 The above studies combined account for a potential mechanism for the female and elder predominance in patients with CC. In contrast, cough induced by meals was more common in male and younger patients. Gastro-esophageal reflux disease was predominantly in males. 29 Also, acid-reflux-induced esophageal damage was more intensively observed in male rats than in female rats. 30 Therefore, age and sex differences should not be overlooked in the evaluation of cough hypersensitivity. The capsaicin challenge test has the same threshold for different sex and age groups. This may be the reason for the large overlap of cough sensitivity between patients with CC and healthy control. Thus, delineating abnormal ranges for different sex and age groups should be considered in assessing cough sensitivity more accurately.

In the present study, capsaicin cough sensitivity had a considerably low correlation with cough sensitivity to daily cough triggers, suggesting little overlap of mechanism in cough hypersensitivity. No significant difference in cough sensitivity to capsaicin and mechanical triggers was found in the present study, indicating that they portray different aspects of cough sensitivity. In addition, an observational study showed RCC presented with different patterns of response to stimuli mediated by Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and transient receptor potential ankyrin 1, with 10.7% of patients hypersensitive to both allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and capsaicin, 11.9% responded only to capsaicin and 18.8% responded only to AITC. 5 All in all, the above results indicate the heterogeneity in cough hypersensitivity and the deficiency of capsaicin challenge tests in evaluating cough sensitivity. A more comprehensive and validated cough-specific measurement tool comprising every type of stimuli, for example, a questionnaire about cough hypersensitivity, should be developed to evaluate cough sensitivity in CC.

Limitations

There are some limitations in the present study. First, response to cough triggers in this study was recorded in the form of binary answer (yes/no) but not an incremental scale to quantify the degree, so it fails to investigate the severity of cough hypersensitivity to triggers. Second, trigger entries for each category may not be comprehensive and need further development, but it can still confirm the insufficient detection of cough sensitivity with capsaicin challenge tests alone. Third, as cough response to cough triggers in healthy volunteers was not investigated in this study, it failed to distinguish physiologic cough response from pathological cough response. Fourth, the patients in this study did not include those who had never visited a doctor due to cough, thus further studies which encompass these subjects are needed.

Despite these limitations, this study provides direction for future research on cough hypersensitivity. Utilization of comprehensive and validated measurement tools for cough sensitivity would be a key to the investigations. It is also worthwhile to investigate the mechanism underlying cough sensitivity to different types of triggers and their role in the management of responsive CC. Moreover, studies involving serial evaluation by these comprehensive and validated measurement tools can demonstrate the effect of a pathological condition or therapeutic intervention on cough reflex sensitivity.

Conclusion

Cough hypersensitivity to cough triggers is a common phenomenon in different causes of CC. However, GERC presents with higher sensitivity to meal triggers and RCC presents with both higher sensitivity to meal triggers and mechanical triggers. In illustrating demographic profiles of cough triggers, females and elders were more sensitive to chemical triggers while cough induced by meals were more common in males and the younger. Different patterns of cough response to cough triggers and capsaicin supported the existence of heterogeneity in cough pathways.

Abstract

背景与目的 肺癌是所有恶性肿瘤中致死率排名最高的恶性肿瘤，其中非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）占所有肺癌的80%-85%。肺叶切除术和淋巴结清扫术是最主要的治疗手段之一，而淋巴结清扫术作为重要组成部分，其清扫方式和清扫范围的选择一直备受关注，可能影响术后并发症，尤其慢性咳嗽的发生。本研究旨在探讨淋巴结清扫方式和清扫区域对行肺叶切除术的NSCLC患者术后慢性咳嗽的影响，为优化手术策略、减少术后慢性咳嗽提供临床依据。方法 回顾性收集2020年12月至2023年12月中国科学技术大学附属第一医院收治的365例接受肺叶切除术治疗的NSCLC患者临床资料，对其临床特征及术后慢性咳嗽之间的关系进行分析。收集患者术前1天及术后8周2个时间节点的中文版莱斯特咳嗽问卷（Mandarin Chinese version of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire, LCQ-MC）评分数据。根据淋巴结清扫方式分组，探讨淋巴结清扫方式与肺叶切除术后患者慢性咳嗽之间的关系。另外，根据术后是否存在慢性咳嗽分为慢性咳嗽组和非慢性咳嗽组，探讨围手术期资料、淋巴结清扫方式及淋巴结清扫区域是否是其影响因素。结果 行肺叶切除术患者中，系统性淋巴结清扫组较淋巴结采样组患者更易发生术后慢性咳嗽（P<0.05）。系统性淋巴结清扫组患者术后8周LCQ-MC量表评估显示，其心理、生理、社会及总分均显著低于淋巴结采样组（P<0.05）。多因素分析提示：麻醉时间、手术位置、淋巴结清扫方式、是否行上纵隔区淋巴结清扫、上纵隔区淋巴结清扫数目、是否行下纵隔区淋巴结清扫和清扫淋巴结总数目是NSCLC患者术后慢性咳嗽的独立危险因素（P<0.05）。结论 NSCLC患者行肺叶切除术治疗时，选择淋巴结采样较系统性淋巴结清扫可显著降低患者术后慢性咳嗽的发生风险。清扫上纵隔区和下纵隔区淋巴结以及清扫淋巴结的数目可能增加患者术后咳嗽的发生风险，降低患者术后的生活质量。

Keywords: 肺肿瘤, 淋巴结清扫方式, 慢性咳嗽, 中文版莱斯特咳嗽问卷

肺癌是全球范围内致死率最高的恶性肿瘤[1,2]，每年大约有180万例患者死于该疾病[3]，其中非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）占所有肺癌的80%-85%[4]。在NSCLC的治疗中，肺叶切除术加淋巴结清扫术是最主要的治疗手段之一，其中淋巴结清扫术作为手术的重要组成部分，其清扫方式和清扫范围的选择一直备受关注[5]。随着医疗技术的不断进步与革新，患者总体生存期得到显著延长，但肺部手术后咳嗽逐渐成为影响患者术后生活质量的重要因素[6]。术后咳嗽指肺部手术后新发或加重的咳嗽，其发生与手术创伤直接相关。慢性咳嗽指咳嗽持续时间超过8周。据统计，肺部手术后出现咳嗽的患者占25%-50%，部分患者如果缺乏早期有效干预会转变为慢性咳嗽，对患者生活质量带来严重影响[7]。研究[8]显示，肺部手术后咳嗽症状受多种因素共同影响，而淋巴结清扫术作为手术过程中的一个重要环节，被认为可能是引起咳嗽的一个潜在原因。其中，淋巴结清扫方式和清扫区域是否与肺叶切除术后慢性咳嗽有一定关联，目前研究较少且结论存在一定争议，需进一步探讨。因此，本研究旨在探讨不同淋巴结清扫方式和清扫区域与行肺叶切除术的NSCLC患者发生术后慢性咳嗽之间的关系。

1 资料与方法
1.1 临床资料

本研究回顾性分析2020年12月至2023年12月于中国科学技术大学附属第一医院胸外科接受肺部手术患者的诊疗数据。纳入标准：（1）接受胸腔镜下肺叶切除术；（2）组织病理学证实为NSCLC；（3）R0切除；（4）无新辅助治疗；（5）基于知情基础上的自愿授权。排除标准：（1）术前出现咳嗽症状或合并呼吸道感染性疾病，涵盖感染（如急性呼吸道感染）、慢性炎症（如慢性阻塞性肺疾病、支气管哮喘）及上气道综合征（如鼻后滴流综合征）；（2）手术中转开放手术；（3）采用肺开放性袖式切除术式；（4）术后出现严重不良事件，包括神经损伤、肺栓塞、乳糜性胸腔积液、肺部感染等；（5）未行淋巴结清扫的肺部手术患者；（6）随访依从性差、拒绝接受随访，或病历记录不完整造成数据缺失。本研究经中国科学技术大学附属第一医院医学研究伦理委员会批准（批准号：2023-RE-364）。

经纳入与排除标准筛选后，最终365例患者符合研究条件，其中男性168例，女性197例。基于术中淋巴结清扫方式，全部患者被分为淋巴结采样组（n=128）和系统性淋巴结清扫组（n=237），采集患者基本信息并在指定时间点（术前1天和术后8周）指导患者完成中文版莱斯特咳嗽问卷（Mandarin Chinese version of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire, LCQ-MC）测评。再根据术后咳嗽持续时间是否超过8周，全部患者被分为慢性咳嗽组（n=130）和非慢性咳嗽组（n=235），统计围手术期资料，进行比较。

1.2 淋巴结清扫方式

系统性淋巴结清扫参照《中华医学会肺癌临床诊疗指南（2023版）》[9]的淋巴结清扫规范，右侧肺癌需清扫2R、4R、7-9及10-14组淋巴结；左侧肺癌需清扫4L、5-9及10-14组淋巴结。

淋巴结采样，作为精准诊断治疗的重要术式，其操作标准为：手术过程中对各区域淋巴结进行系统性探查，当发现可疑转移病灶时，实施整组淋巴结完全摘除，以确保病理评估的完整性；若探查未见明确转移征象的淋巴结，则采取目标区域组织样本送检。该术式通过选择性取样策略，在保证诊断准确性的同时最大程度降低手术创伤。

1.3 清扫淋巴结区域

根据国际肺癌研究协会（International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, IASLC）最新淋巴结分区标准[10]，肺癌淋巴结可分7个区域、14组，其转移范围是临床分期的重要依据。根据淋巴结清扫原则，将清扫淋巴结区主要分为以下4组：（1）上纵隔区淋巴结（第2-4组）：包括右上气管旁淋巴结、左上气管旁淋巴结、血管前淋巴结、气管后淋巴结和下段气管旁淋巴结；（2）主动脉区淋巴结（第5-6组）：包括主动脉下淋巴结和主动脉旁淋巴结；（3）下纵隔区淋巴结（第7-9组）：包括隆突下淋巴结、食管旁淋巴结和肺韧带淋巴结；（4）肺门及肺周围区淋巴结（第10-14组）：包括肺门淋巴结、肺叶间淋巴结、肺叶淋巴结、肺段淋巴结及肺段以下淋巴结。

1.4 咳嗽评价指标

本研究采用LCQ-MC作为评估工具，系统分析咳嗽对患者生活质量的影响，采用生理、心理和社会3个维度的量表进行全面评估[11]，共19个评估项目，其中有8个生理项目、7个心理项目和4个社会项目，每个项目采用7级评分法（正向计分，1-7分，咳嗽程度越轻，分数越高）。各维度得分为对应维度项目均值，总分为3个维度得分之和。本研究纳入的365例患者在2位经过规范化培训的医务人员监督下，分别在术前1天和术后8周2个时间节点进行量表评测。

1.5 统计学分析

采用SPSS 26.0统计学软件录入数据，并进行相应统计分析。首先应用Shaprio-Wilk法检验连续变量的正态性，对符合正态分布的变量，采用均数±标准差（Mean±SD）进行统计描述，组间差异比较采用独立样本t检验，不符合正态分布的变量，则用中位数（四分位间距）[M(P25, P75)]表示，应用Mann-Whitney U法进行组间比较。采用频数（构成比）描述分类变量，组间差异分析使用Pearson卡方检验。慢性咳嗽组和非慢性咳嗽组的比较，首先采用单因素分析，对于单因素分析有统计学意义的变量纳入多因素Logistic回归模型进一步分析。P<0.05则提示统计数据差异有统计学意义。

咳嗽作为NSCLC患者极为常见的术后并发症，若未能及时干预处理，可能会发展为慢性咳嗽，显著降低患者的生活质量。LCQ-MC问卷在评估肺部疾病患者咳嗽症状的严重程度、发作频率、强度及其对生活质量影响方面展现出良好的可信度。Xie[12]和Pan[13]等研究表明，LCQ-MC问卷在评价胸腔镜术后NSCLC患者咳嗽症状方面具有有效、简便且可靠的特性。本研究通过比较两组患者的问卷结果发现，术后8周的LCQ-MC评分存在显著差异，系统性淋巴结清扫组的评分较淋巴结采样组更低，且系统性淋巴结清扫组的LCQ-MC评分较术前出现了更为显著的下滑。这一变化趋势证实了淋巴结清扫方式是肺部手术后慢性咳嗽的影响因素，这也与Gu等[14]的研究保持一致。

淋巴结清扫术作为NSCLC肺叶切除术中重要的一环，能提高肿瘤术后病理分期的准确性，然而清扫操作可能增加周围组织创伤，导致咳嗽。本研究证明，不同的淋巴结清扫方式是NSCLC患者术后发生慢性咳嗽的独立危险因素。Wu等[15]通过比较咳嗽组和非咳嗽组共517例患者的临床资料和治疗结果发现，术中采用系统性淋巴结清扫术的患者比采用淋巴结采样术的患者更易发生术后咳嗽。Chen等[16]回顾性分析了196例电视辅助胸腔镜右侧NSCLC根治性切除的临床资料，发现淋巴结采样有效减少了术后慢性咳嗽的发生。淋巴结清扫方式影响患者术后慢性咳嗽的机制主要有以下几种可能：（1）系统性淋巴结清扫范围广，极可能触及喉部、气管、隆突及大的肺支气管的咳嗽感受器和迷走神经分支，此过程潜在地干扰了咳嗽的神经反射通路，从而诱发术后咳嗽反应；（2）系统性淋巴结清扫相比较于淋巴结采样，清扫淋巴结数目较多，手术步骤更多，同时就会伴随着更长的手术与麻醉耗时，以及对气管造成更为显著的额外刺激；（3）系统性淋巴结清扫会导致更大范围的组织创伤，引起持续性的局部炎症，刺激咳嗽感受器；（4）系统性淋巴结清扫中，大量淋巴结清扫可能会破坏淋巴管网，切断肺内淋巴回流途径，导致淋巴液流动阻力增加，造成淋巴液淤积，形成微循环障碍，刺激支气管周围神经和咳嗽反应受体，诱发慢性咳嗽[17,18]。Shen-Tu等[19]表明，淋巴结采样与系统性淋巴结清扫在肿瘤分期和生存率方面未显示出显著性差异，尤其是在早期NSCLC患者中，淋巴结采样同样能够准确评估淋巴结转移状态。Huang等[20]针对早期NSCLC患者的研究表明淋巴结采样与系统性清扫在总生存期、局部复发率及远处转移率方面无统计学差异。因此，对于早期NSCLC患者，淋巴结采样在生存率方面无明显差异的情况下，能够显著降低术后慢性咳嗽的发生率。

本研究通过对慢性咳嗽组与非慢性咳嗽组进行单因素和多因素分析，再次证实淋巴结清扫方式是NSCLC患者术后慢性咳嗽的独立危险因素。在淋巴结清扫区域和数目方面，我们发现上纵隔区淋巴结、下纵隔区淋巴结清扫以及淋巴结清扫数目均被确定为NSCLC患者术后慢性咳嗽的独立危险因素。Huang等[21]对肺部手术患者进行气管旁淋巴结清扫并且用自体脂肪填塞，研究发现，肺部手术后咳嗽发生率显著降低。Sawabata等[22]对240例肺切除术患者进行了术后咳嗽视觉模拟评分（visual analog scale, VAS）问卷调查并分析，发现纵隔淋巴结清扫是导致术后咳嗽持续存在的因素之一。Wu等[23]基于对19项病例对照研究的系统分析，纳入4755例肺切除患者数据，发现纵隔区淋巴结清扫及隆突下淋巴结清扫是肺切除术后咳嗽的独立危险因素。可能的原因为迷走神经C纤维的刺激。迷走神经C纤维是最关键的咳嗽受体，大多数感觉神经纤维包括C纤维，分布在咽喉、气管、隆突、较大的支气管和肺中，而上纵隔区和下纵隔区淋巴结附近就有这些咳嗽受体的分布。淋巴结清扫数目的增加，增加了手术的范围和复杂性，提高了对周围组织尤其是对迷走神经纤维的损伤风险，导致气道敏感增加，术后更易发生慢性咳嗽。为了尽量规避或者减少因过度手术带来的术后慢性咳嗽，选择合理的淋巴结清扫方式，对于需要淋巴结清扫的患者，在不降低手术治疗效果的前提下，尤其在清扫上纵隔区和下纵隔区淋巴结，须尽可能保护迷走神经C纤维和局部组织，以降低术后咳嗽的发生率。

在本研究中，我们还发现手术位置也是术后慢性咳嗽的独立危险因素，这与Xie等[12]研究结果一致，右肺叶手术肺切除术后咳嗽的风险更大。Mu等[24]认为右上叶切除术可能是肺切除术后持续咳嗽的独立危险因素。原因可能是右肺上叶有更多神经C纤维可能处于无菌性炎症微环境中。

综上所述，行肺叶切除术的NSCLC患者中淋巴结采样较系统性淋巴结清扫导致术后慢性咳嗽的发生率更低，而清扫的淋巴结区域和数目是术后慢性咳嗽的危险因素，尤其上纵隔区和下纵隔区淋巴结清扫会增加术后慢性咳嗽的发生率。因此，针对早期NSCLC患者，术中优先行淋巴结采样有助于降低术后慢性咳嗽的发生率，从而显著提升患者术后的生活质量。但是，本研究存在一定的局限性。首先，这项研究采用小样本、单中心研究设计进行回顾性分析，所选择的病例可能引入了偏倚。因此，当前研究结论需通过多中心、大样本前瞻性随机对照设计验证，以弥补现有证据的局限并增强结论可靠性。另外，本研究未对咳嗽患者的治疗方案进行随访，后续研究应加强这一环节的探索。

Summary
Background

Chronic cough is a prevalent and difficult to treat condition often accompanied by cough hypersensitivity, characterised by cough triggered from exposure to low level sensory stimuli. The mechanisms underlying cough hypersensitivity may involve alterations in airway sensory nerve responsivity to tussive stimuli which would be accompanied by alterations in stimulus-induced brainstem activation, measurable with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Methods

We investigated brainstem responses during inhalation of capsaicin and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in 29 participants with chronic cough and 29 age- and sex-matched controls. Psychophysical testing was performed to evaluate individual sensitivities to inhaled stimuli and fMRI was used to compare neural activation in participants with cough and control participants while inhaling stimulus concentrations that evoked equivalent levels of urge-to-cough sensation.

Findings

Participants with chronic cough were significantly more sensitive to inhaled capsaicin and ATP and showed a change in relationship between urge-to-cough perception and cough induction. When urge-to-cough levels were matched, participants with chronic cough displayed significantly less neural activation in medullary regions known to integrate airway sensory inputs. By contrast, neural activations did not differ significantly between the two groups in cortical brain regions known to encode cough sensations whereas activation in a midbrain region of participants with chronic cough was significantly increased compared to controls.

Interpretation

Cough hypersensitivity in some patients may occur in brain circuits above the level of the medulla, perhaps involving midbrain regions that amplify ascending sensory signals or change the efficacy of central inhibitory control systems that ordinarily serve to filter sensory inputs.

Research in context.
Evidence before this study

Chronic cough in adults, regardless of the aetiology, is widely considered to be a hypersensitivity disorder in which coughing is triggered by relatively low levels of thermal, mechanical or chemical stimuli. The site of this hypersensitivity has been presumed to include the airway vagal sensory nerve fibres, such that they become more responsive to stimuli and therefore more readily able to evoke coughing. Although the mechanisms leading to vagal hypersensitivity have not been identified, inflammatory mediators such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) have been implicated and this has led to major advancements of purinergic (P2X3) receptor antagonists through clinical trials for treating chronic refractory cough. Nevertheless, the precise neurobiological actions of ATP in human cough hypersensitivity are unknown but could be investigated by assessing the patterns of brainstem neural activation using functional brain imaging associated during ATP challenges in patients with chronic cough compared to healthy controls.

Added value of this study

Contrary to the prevailing hypothesis, the results observed in patients with chronic cough in the present study are inconsistent with substantive increased sensitivity of peripheral cough evoking sensory fibres as a primary mechanism contributing to cough hypersensitivity. Instead, cough hypersensitivity may involve amplification of low levels of vagal sensory input to the medullary brainstem through altered higher brain processes.

Implications of all the available evidence

These findings support and extend our previous work demonstrating that changes in how the central nervous system processes incoming vagal sensory signals occur in patients with chronic cough. The findings challenge our understanding of cough hypersensitivity and therefore may reshape future therapeutic approaches to manage this challenging clinical condition.

Introduction

Chronic cough is a prevalent clinical problem, affecting as many as 10% of the global population and commonly associated with pulmonary, gastro-oesophageal reflux (GERD) or nasal (e.g., rhinosinusitis) diseases.1,2 Individuals with chronic cough characteristically display signs of cough hypersensitivity, a condition characterised by a lowered threshold for cough initiation indicative of heightened nervous system responses to airway stimuli.2,3 For many people with chronic cough, treating their associated disease restores cough sensitivity and relieves coughing. However, for a significant percentage of people chronic cough can be insensitive to therapeutic intervention, despite effective management of their associated conditions (termed refractory chronic cough, RCC),2,4, 5, 6 or present without evidence of an associative or causative condition, despite extensive clinical investigation (termed unexplained chronic cough, UCC).2,4, 5, 6 Effective management of RCC and UCC therefore relies on therapeutic approaches that target the processes that mediate cough hypersensitivity and/or induce coughing, rather than therapies that treat diseases commonly associated with chronic cough.7 Consequently, efforts have focussed on understanding putative mechanisms that regulate peripheral and central processes involved in cough neural circuit activity as targeting these will likely prove effective in the management of RCC and UCC.2,7

Recent studies in animals and humans have identified adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an important endogenous signalling molecule involved in the development of chronic cough, perhaps released from injured or activated airway epithelial cells during inflammation or irritant exposure.2,8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 ATP acts on cough-evoking sensory nerve fibres through purinergic receptors, including both the heteromeric and homomeric P2X2/3 and P2X3 receptors, respectively.9,10 In support of this, recent clinical trials have demonstrated antitussive actions of several antagonists with P2X2/3 and P2X3 activity in RCC and UCC,2,14,15 consistent with a role for ATP release in the airways leading to the subsequent activation or sensitisation of cough evoking vagal sensory nerve fibres. However, preclinical animal studies have shown that ATP reliably activates only one of the two known cough evoking sensory neural pathways in healthy airways.9,10,16 This may also be true in humans. Thus, using functional brain imaging (fMRI) in healthy humans12 we showed that inhalation of the cough-evoking stimulant capsaicin resulted in medullary brainstem activations that encompassed both the nucleus of the solitary tract and paratrigeminal nucleus, regions where capsaicin-sensitive airway sensory neurons arising from the nodose and jugular vagal ganglia, respectively, are known to project.16 By contrast, when these same participants inhaled ATP, medulla activations were largely restricted to the nucleus of the solitary tract, suggestive that ATP preferentially activated the nodose cough pathway.12,16

Although ATP may specifically activate nodose sensory neural pathways in healthy airways, it is conceivable that the pattern of neural circuitry activated by ATP may be altered in cough hypersensitivity. To investigate this, we have again employed fMRI, this time to interrogate the potential brainstem pathways involved in ATP-evoked cough responses in RCC or UCC compared to control participants without chronic cough. We set out to test the hypothesis that changes in the activation patterns in the brainstem evoked by inhaled ATP in participants with chronic cough may inform the identity of neural circuits responsible for the hypersensitive state under pathological conditions.

Methods
Ethics

The study and procedures were approved by the University of Melbourne (project number 1852642) and Monash University (registration number 17642) Human Research Ethics Committees and conform to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki (last modified in 2013). The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03722849). All participants were initially screened via telephone interviews for inclusion and exclusion criteria and gave written, informed consent prior to study enrolment.

Participants

The study was open to both male and female participants (sex self-reported by study participants), although chronic cough is significantly more prevalent in females.17 Chronic cough was diagnosed by a respiratory or laryngology specialist or general practitioner and inclusion required cough of at least 6 months duration with no abnormalities on chest X-ray or CT scan, and 61 potential participants with chronic cough were initially identified (Fig. 1). Of these, n = 29 were enrolled into the study, along with n = 29 age- and sex-matched control participants (without chronic cough). One male participant with chronic cough did not complete MRI scans after initial psychophysical testing due to personal circumstances. One female control participant withdrew from the study during the MRI scanning due to claustrophobia. Thus, a total of 56 participants (n = 28 per group) completed the full study and were included in the final fMRI data analyses.

Summary of screening and recruitment for participants with chroniccough.

Cough challenge testing

Nebulised saline, capsaicin and ATP were used to investigate individuals’ cough psychophysical characteristics. Sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) served as a control substance. Capsaicin (Sigma, Australia) was prepared at a stock concentration of 125 μM and serially diluted to achieve a concentration range of 0.12–62.5 μM as described previously.13,18, 19, 20 ATP (Sigma, Australia) was prepared at a stock concentration of 465 mM and serially diluted to achieve a concentration range of 0.45–232.5 mM as previously described.12 All dilutions were prepared fresh on the day of testing and participants inhaled nebulised vapour of saline, capsaicin or ATP via a face mask which was connected to jet nebuliser (RapidFlo; Allersearch, Scoresby, Victoria, Australia). The nebuliser cups containing each concentration of capsaicin or ATP were connected via a tubing to the jet nebuliser which generated vapour (∼2–3 μm particle size). During the fMRI data acquisition, compressed medical air (5 L min−1) was used to generate vapour and a series of parallel shut-off valves directed the air to one of the three nebulisers (containing saline, capsaicin or ATP) during the stimulus periods, or to a vent for passive exhaust during non-stimulus periods. Each nebuliser was connected in parallel to the face mask via independent tubing, preventing direct mixing of test reagents.

Experimental design
Psychophysical assessment of sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin and ATP

All enrolled participants completed the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ),21 Newcastle Laryngeal Hypersensitivity Questionnaire (LHQ),22 and Hull Cough Hypersensitivity Questionnaire (HARQ).3 The urge-to-cough threshold (Cu), defined as the first concentration of stimulus to evoke a perceptible level of urge-to-cough, and the cough threshold (C2), defined as the first concentration of stimulus to elicit two coughs or more, were determined by single vital capacity inhalation of doubling concentrations of capsaicin and ATP via the mouth as recommended23 and described in our previous studies.12,19,20,24 The order of testing for capsaicin and ATP was randomised among the participants. Immediately after each inhalation, participants rated their level of urge-to-cough using a Borg scale ranging from 0 (no urge) to 10 (most intense urge imaginable). Participants recorded the nature and locations of evoked sensations using body map charts. To limit exposure to test substances, each test concentration was presented only once to participants to estimate Cu and C2. In preparation for fMRI scanning, the maximum suppressible stimulus concentration (Smax), defined as the highest possible concentration of stimulus participants could repeatedly inhale over 24 s of tidal breathing without coughing, was subsequently determined for both capsaicin and ATP using a method of limits.12,20 Participants were challenged with progressively higher stimulus concentrations over 24 s until breakthrough coughing was evoked, after which the final Smax concentration was refined by retesting participants using stimulus concentrations above and below that initially identified.

fMRI scanning parameters

Functional brain imaging was performed at Monash Biomedical Imaging, Clayton, Australia using a Siemens Skyra 3T scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) and a 32-channel head coil. All but 3 participants underwent fMRI scanning on the same day as cough challenge testing. The maximum duration between cough challenge testing and scanning was 7 days. Immediately prior to scanning, confirmation of the chosen Smax stimulus concentration was performed for all participants, regardless of when their original cough challenge testing was performed, and minor adjustments were made to the delivered stimulus if necessary to limit coughing (defined as fMRI stimulus concentration). In the scanner, participants wore earplugs for ear protection from the MRI scanner noise and lay on the patient table of the MRI scanner with their heads stabilised with foam padding and their arms supported by sandbags. A nebuliser mask connected to three nebulisers was placed and secured over the participants’ nose and mouth for delivery of saline, capsaicin or ATP.

High resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired at the resolution of 1 × 1 × 1 mm3 with MPRAGE sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 1900 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.07 ms, inversion time = 900 ms, flip angle = 9°, matrix = 256 × 256. Four fMRI scans with a view localised to the brainstem (Fig. 2) were performed with an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: TR = 1930 ms, TE = 31 ms, flip angle = 90°, total number of volumes = 186, slice thickness = 2.6 mm, total number of slices = 21. The slices had 1.8 × 1.8 mm2 in-plane resolution and a matrix of 106 × 106 that constituted a field of view (FOV) of sufficient size to incorporate a portion of the brain hemispheres rostral to the brainstem (Fig. 2).

Overview of fMRI experimental design. (a) Control participants and participants with chronic cough underwent inhaled cough challenge testing during brainstem optimised functional imaging (restricted field of view highlighted by yellow shaping). (b) ATP and capsaicin challenge concentrations were individually tailored to produce behaviourally equivalent levels of urge-to-cough in all participants. Stimuli were delivered across four brain imaging runs, comprising two 24 s blocks each of saline, capsaicin, and ATP inhalation (6 blocks/run in total).

An additional image with the same slice orientation as in brainstem fMRI images with 70 slices that covered the whole brain was also acquired for registration purposes with similar parameters (TR = 6370 ms, TE = 31 ms, matrix = 106 × 192). Fieldmap images were acquired for correction of distortion with the following parameters: TR = 744 ms; TE = 4.92 ms; slice thickness = 3.3 mm; total number of slices = 70.

fMRI scanning with inhalation of tussive agents

Participants received visual instructions through a mirror attached to the head coil that allowed them to view a screen outside the scanner. Visual cues were presented by a Windows computer running Presentation software (Neurobehavioural Systems) and included the following: “prepare to inhale” 3 s prior to the onset of each inhalation period; “go” to align the first inspiratory phase to the onset of stimulus delivery, “prepare to rate” after the conclusion of the inhalation period and “rate your urge-to-cough” during which participants indicated their urge-to-cough ratings via a trackball combination mouse (Fig. 2). A visual fixation cross was displayed during the rest period (35 s) as well as during the inhalation challenges (24 s). Most participants completed 4 fMRI scans. The exceptions were one control participant who completed only 3 fMRI scans due to urgent bathroom needs, one participant with chronic cough who completed only 3 fMRI scans due to coughing bouts during the scans and one participant with chronic cough who completed only 2 fMRI scans due to issues with viewing of the visual instructions. Each fMRI scan included 6 blocks of nebulised stimuli (2 each for saline, capsaicin and ATP delivered in a pseudorandom order, Fig. 2). Any behavioural changes during the fMRI scans, such as total number of coughs, with the inhalation challenges were also noted down.

Analysis of the fMRI data was performed in FSL (FMRIB’s software library; https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/) that included the FSL Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT, version 6.0.3). Non-brain voxels were stripped from the anatomical and functional MRI images using the brain extraction tool,25 motion-correction was performed using the MCFLIRT tool,26 spatial distortion was corrected using fieldmaps and FMRIB’s Utility for Geometrically Unwarping EPIs (FUGUE)27 and spatial smoothing was performed with a Gaussian kernel of 3.0 mm full width at half maximum, and the data high pass filtered with a cut-off of 0.01 Hz.

Registration of the functional MRI data to the standard Montreal Neurological Institutes (MNI) template was performed in three steps using FLIRT (FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool). First, linear registration of motion-corrected and unwarped functional brainstem EPI data to the unwarped whole brain mean EPI was performed. Next, the unwarped whole brain mean EPI image was linearly registered to the high-resolution structural T1-weighted image, and the latter image to the standard MNI152 template brain (1-mm resolution). Multiplication of the three matrices was used to transform statistical parametric maps from the native to the standard space for analysis of group effects.

BOLD data series were analysed with a general linear model with prewhitening for local autocorrelation.28 Regressors representing the timing for inhalation of saline, capsaicin and ATP were included as explanatory variables (EVs) in the general linear model. The timings for presentation of other visual cues and rating tasks were also included as EVs. To account for physiological noise, confound regressors were also included in the general linear model. Having been described in previous studies by our group,12,24 these confound regressors have been adopted according to the outcomes of empirical studies that assessed the influence of respiration on BOLD signal variance, and how this variance can be modelled when the events of interest are likely to correlate with respiration,29, 30, 31 as is the case in this study. Notably, the manifestation of respiratory-related variance in BOLD signal is not reliably predicted from concurrent recordings of the respiratory cycle, being more accurately represented in recordings of the BOLD time series from carefully selected regions. These regions, including the white matter and ventricles, are likely to show respiratory and other physiological-related noise while being less likely to incorporate variance associated with neural events. Additionally, a confound regressor was included that was identified after creating a standard deviation image from each of the BOLD time series acquired from patients and control participants. This noisy cofound regressor corresponded to the time series of the voxel with the highest standard deviation in the image and was typically located near the midline at the superior margin of the brain in a region likely to include the sagittal sinus. Six motion parameters (three translations, three rotations) were also included as confound regressors. Participants with chronic cough had an increased tendency to cough upon inhalation of tussive agents during fMRI scans compared to healthy controls (for capsaicin: 5.21 ± 6.05 vs. 0.928 ± 2.12 coughs, P = 0.0054; for ATP: 2.57 ± 3.55 vs. 0.57 ± 1.91 coughs, P = 0.0072; for saline: 0.14 ± 0.59 vs. 0 ± 0, P = 0.4919). These breakthrough coughing events were not always temporally aligned with the 24 s stimulus blocks. Thus, for participants with cough vs. control participants, cough during stimulus blocks for capsaicin and ATP equalled 3.67 ± 5.16 vs. 0.89 ± 0.21 (P = 0.0868) and 1.32 ± 2.74 vs. 0.50 ± 1.67 (P = 0.3954), respectively. To identify and account for the occasional signal distortions that accompanied breakthrough coughing events, an automated algorithm for detecting cough-related distortions in the BOLD signal was developed in-house in Python (version 3.9) (unpublished) and detections were used as additional EVs in the general linear model as previously reported.19,20

An additional confound variable that represented widely distributed signal changes across the acquired partial brain volume was generated. Preliminary activation maps of the main effects of interest (ATP, ATP > Saline, Capsaicin, Capsaicin > Saline) were created. All voxels showing activation for any main effect in either group were excluded from the partial brain volume, and mean signals across the remaining voxels were used to create the large volume confound regressor. This approach was used to further characterise changes in BOLD signal due to respiratory-related noise,12,19,20,32 as advocated to model global effects while excluding the contribution of activation to this variance.33 An assessment of the level of BOLD signal variance and any associations between signals measured from confound regressors and effects of interest is provided in Supplementary Information.

Contrasts of parameter estimates (COPEs) were calculated for each EV (saline, capsaicin, ATP, rating, etc.) and for differences among the three inhalation stimuli (Capsaicin > Saline, ATP > Saline) or between cohorts (Control Participant > Cough Participant and vice versa). Higher level analyses were performed after transforming these statistical parametric maps representing COPEs to the standard MNI space. At the second level analyses, a fixed effects model was used to calculate average effects out of the four different runs for each participant. At the group level analyses, the outputs of the second level analyses were used as inputs and a mixed effects model was used. Demeaned urge-to-cough ratings for capsaicin were used as an additional regressor in the group level analyses to examine the relationship between the behaviour and the level of activations. In line with our previous brainstem fMRI study,12 the outcomes of the group level analyses were thresholded to include only the voxels with Z values >2.3 and cluster probability level of P < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons based on Gaussian random field theory.34

Regions of interest (ROIs), identified using whole group (n = 56) activation maps, neuroanatomical maps35 and our prior studies,12,24 were defined by manually creating masks over voxels in activated clusters from the Capsaicin > Saline and ATP > Saline contrasts. These masks included voxels likely corresponding to ROIs in the left and right nucleus of the solitary tract, left and right paratrigeminal nucleus, left midbrain, right anterior cingulate cortex and left primary somatosensory cortex, regions comprising core elements of the urge-to-cough network.12 Percentage signal changes from each of the ROIs were extracted using FEATQUERY tool from the FSL package.

Statistics

Sample size estimates were made using BOLD signal changes extracted from regions of interest reported in our previous study12 and analysed with fMRIpower.36 Inclusion of 25 participants per group afforded at least 80% power to detect a between-group difference of 0.48–0.72 standard deviation units in the regions of interest. Participants were included if their chronic cough exhibited features of RCC or UCC, including a history of unsuccessful therapy interventions or an absence of identified comorbid conditions that can cause chronic cough. Exclusion criteria included conditions that could potentially affect cough sensitivity such as chronic respiratory disease, neurological disease or recent acute respiratory infection, a history of smoking during the previous 5 years, conditions that could influence MRI safety such as recent surgery and MR-unsafe implants, use of medications that were likely to influence cough sensitivity, brain activity and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The study was single blinded as participants (but not investigators) were blinded to the identity of the challenge stimulus order used in the fMRI scanning.

All statistical analyses of demographic and behavioural data were performed in GraphPad Prism (version 9). Data sets were first tested for normality using the D'Agostino-Pearson test to determine appropriate parametric or non-parametric groupwise tests. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. See also statistical summary table (Supplementary Material Table S1).

Differences in group demographics were assessed using unpaired t-tests (age) or Mann–Whitney U tests (cough duration) reflecting the normality of the data. Mean (overall) and subdomain response scores to questionnaires were investigated using multiple Mann–Whitney U tests with correction for multiple comparisons with Holm-Šídák's method, as data were not normally distributed.

The stimulus response data were log-transformed37 to restore data to linearity and calculate Cu, C2, Smax and fMRI values for capsaicin and ATP. Between group differences in stimulus response measures were analysed with two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Šídák's multiple comparisons testing, as the transformed data were normally distributed, and independence existed among testing statistics of interest. Difference scores between urge-to-cough ratings at Cu and C2 stimulus concentrations were calculated by subtracting the urge-to-cough ratings at C2 from those at Cu (defined as C2-Cu UTC difference) and tested for significant differences between group effects using unpaired t-tests, as data were normally distributed. Sensory experiences and body maps were recorded as the proportion of respondents for each response option and differences between cohorts analysed using Fisher’s exact test. The sum of terms used to describe participant experiences during capsaicin and ATP inhalation was calculated and compared between groups using unpaired t-tests. Mean urge-to-cough ratings induced by inhalation of saline, capsaicin and ATP across four fMRI runs were calculated and compared between groups using two-way ANOVA followed by Šídák's multiple comparisons testing, as data were normally distributed, and independence existed among testing variables of interest. Total numbers of coughs during the fMRI scans were compared with multiple Mann–Whitney U tests with correction for multiple comparisons with Holm-Šídák's method given their non-normal distribution.

For fMRI data, the mean percentage BOLD signal changes for each ROI across four runs were calculated for each participant and differences between ROIs, as planned a priori, were compared between the control and the chronic cough groups using non-parametric Mann–Whitney U tests as data were not normally distributed.

Results
Participant demographics

Control participants and participants with chronic cough displayed no significant group differences between sex and age demographics. Consistent with the known demographics of chronic cough,17 65.5% of participants were female with an overall average age of 60.1 ± 12.0 years (Table 1). The mean duration of self-reported chronic cough by participants was 14.3 ± 14.6 years, with more than half of the participants having chronic cough for over 10 years and 4 participants reporting ongoing troublesome cough persisting for 3–5 decades of their life. None of the enrolled participants with chronic cough had any comorbid lung disease and based on their clinical histories assessed by respiratory or laryngology specialists or general practitioners, all were suspected to have refractory or unexplained chronic cough. Scores across the HARQ, Newcastle LHQ and LCQ, and their subdomains, for participants with chronic cough were highly significantly different (P values ranged from P = 0.0022 to P < 0.0001; Multiple Mann–Whitney U tests with correction for multiple comparison), to control participants, indicative of the burden of their chronic cough (Table 1).

Behavioural responses to inhalation of capsaicin and ATP

Psychophysical responses to inhalation of nebulised capsaicin and ATP showed differences between participants with chronic cough and the healthy participant cohort (Fig. 3). Saline inhalation produced no urge-to-cough sensation in any control participants (group rating = 0.0 ± 0.0) and a small urge-to-cough in 6 participants with chronic cough (group rating = 0.5 ± 1.2). A significant difference in response sensitivity between control participants and participants with chronic cough was observed for capsaicin and ATP (F(2,165) = 25.4, P < 0.0001, F(2,165) = 27.3, P < 0.0001; two-way ANOVA, respectively). Post-hoc multiple comparison testing showed that participants with chronic cough had significantly lower capsaicin thresholds to evoke two or more coughs (C2, P = 0.0018) and a lower maximum concentration that could be inhaled for 24 s without coughing (Smax, P = 0.0031). Similarly for ATP inhalation, participants with chronic cough displayed significantly lower C2 (P < 0.0001) and Smax (P < 0.0001) thresholds. Notably, even though both capsaicin and ATP urge-to-cough thresholds were lower in participants with chronic cough compared to controls, this did not reach statistical significance (Cu capsaicin, P = 0.081; Cu ATP, P = 0.282). Urge-to-cough ratings were related to stimulus concentration in the psychophysical testing session, and consequently the urge-to-cough levels reported at Cu and C2 challenge concentrations were significantly different for both capsaicin and ATP (F(3,110) = 37.8, P < 0.0001, F(3,110) = 29.8, P < 0.0001, respectively; one-way ANOVA) in heathy and cough cohorts (Fig. 3). However, participants with chronic cough consistently reached their C2 cough threshold at lower urge-to-cough ratings. Thus, the difference between urge-to-cough ratings at Cu and C2 stimulus concentrations was significantly smaller in participants with chronic cough for both capsaicin (t(56) = 4.2, P < 0.0001; unpaired t-test) and ATP (t(56) = 3.3, P = 0.002; unpaired t-test). Compared to control participants, participants with chronic cough had significantly higher number of coughs to both capsaicin and ATP (4.64 ± 2.47 vs. 2.59 ± 1.12 coughs; P = 0.0003, and 4.71 ± 2.58 vs. 2.14 ± 1.22, P = 0.0001, multiple Mann–Whitney U tests with correction for multiple comparisons) at C2 concentrations.

Comparison of capsaicin and ATP psychophysical cough indices in control participants and participants with chronic cough. Upper panels show (a) Capsaicin and (b) ATP behavioural thresholds. Lower panels show urge-to-cough ratings provided by control participants and participants with chronic cough while inhaling Cu and C2 concentrations of (c, d) capsaicin and (e, f) ATP. C2-Cu urge-to-cough rating difference scores were calculated for both capsaicin (d) and ATP (f). Cu, Urge-to-cough threshold; C2, stimulus concentration producing two spontaneous coughs; Smax, maximum stimulus concentration tolerated without coughing during 24 s of repeated inhalation. Data points represent individual participants (horizontal line denotes mean and error bars are standard deviation) of n = 29 per group. P values calculated using two-way ANOVA with Šídák's multiple comparison tests (a, b) and unpaired t-tests (c–f).

During fMRI scanning, stimulus type (saline, capsaicin, ATP) was a significant factor in variance of urge-to-cough ratings (F(2,156) = 57.01, P < 0.0001; two-way ANOVA). Group (control, chronic cough) was not a significant factor (F(1,156) = 1.17, P = 0.280), but there was an interaction between group and stimulus type (F(2,156) = 3.46, P = 0.041). Subsequent post hoc testing showed that whilst urge-to-cough ratings during saline challenges were significantly lower than urge-to-cough ratings during challenges with fMRI concentrations of capsaicin and ATP (P < 0.0001), there were no group differences between the levels of urge-to-cough evoked by capsaicin (P = 0.997) and ATP (P = 0.285). However to achieve this matched behavioural experience, significant differences in the concentration of inhaled capsaicin and ATP were required for control participants and participants with chronic cough (t(54) = 2.0, P = 0.046, t(54) = 3.4, P = 0.002; unpaired t-test; Fig. 4). Tests for sex-related differences were not significant for any of the comparisons above (P values ranged from P = 0.1006 to P > 0.9999). As we previously reported,12 stimulus order was not a factor affecting urge-to-cough ratings during scanning (Supplementary Table S2) consistent with no known interactions between capsaicin and ATP. Urge-to-cough ratings across individual scanning runs for both cohorts did not differ for either capsaicin or ATP (Supplementary Table S3), suggesting an absence of response tachyphylaxis over the course of the scanning session, again consistent with our previous study.12

Slices and region co-ordinates displayed were chosen based on the outcomes of our prior fMRI studies.12,20,24,32 Atlas drawings show the expected location of brainstem regions of interest (modified from35).

Participants also reported a range of sensations associated with inhalation of capsaicin and ATP (Table 2). Most participants, regardless of cough status, reported inhalation of capsaicin and ATP inhalation as irritating and associated with a tickle, while a minority experienced itchy, burning, hot, stinging, and breathless sensations during inhalation challenges. Almost all participants recorded the body map localisation of sensations over the throat area, with a minority also noting sensations in the chest, mouth, and nose. Notably, there were no significant differences between control participants and participants with chronic cough with respect to the relative frequency of each sensory experience or its location values ranged from (P = 0.18 to P = 0.78; Fisher’s exact test). However, participants with chronic cough tended to choose significantly more terms in total to describe their experience during capsaicin inhalation (t(56) = 2.3, P = 0.024; unpaired t-test), although this was not the case for ATP challenges (t(56) = 0.8, P = 0.429; unpaired t-test).

Regional BOLD signal changes associated with capsaicin and ATP inhalation

Combined analysis of fMRI data from all participants (n = 56) revealed the locations of activations in common for control participants and participants with chronic cough (Fig. 4; Table 3). In the cerebral hemispheres, noting the restricted imaging field of view available, Capsaicin > Saline and ATP > Saline activations were distributed across overlapping territories in the somatosensory and midcingulate cortices, consistent with previous studies.12,19,20,32 In the brainstem, Capsaicin > Saline and ATP > Saline activations encompassed regions of the dorsomedial and dorsolateral medulla, extending for several millimetres above and below the level of the Obex, as previously reported.12 The Capsaicin > Saline cluster was more prominent and included medullary territories that likely contained vagal sensory processing sites in the dorsomedial brainstem (at z = −55), including the nucleus of the solitary tract, and the dorsolateral brainstem (at z = −58), including the spinal trigeminal nucleus and paratrigeminal nucleus. The ATP > Saline activation cluster in the caudal medulla (z = −55) displayed a prominent dorsomedial location, in the region of the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract, but additionally extended laterally (at z = −58) into areas that likely encompassed parts of the spinal trigeminal nucleus.

Control participants (n = 28) displayed comparable Capsaicin > Saline and ATP > Saline BOLD activation profiles in the brainstem and cortex as those observed for the whole group (n = 56), with BOLD signal magnitudes (Fig. 5) comparable to our prior studies (e.g.,12,20) and other published studies of noxious stimulus evoked BOLD responses.38,39 Surprisingly, however, participants with chronic cough failed to yield any medullary brainstem activations at a cluster corrected level for either Capsaicin > Saline or ATP > Saline contrasts, despite the cough and control cohorts demonstrating comparable cluster-corrected BOLD signal responses to both agents in cortical ROIs. Consequently, none of the medullary or cortical ROIs demonstrated Cough participant > Control participant responses for either capsaicin or ATP. The percentage BOLD signal change (Fig. 5a and b) measured from the nucleus of the solitary tract was significantly lower in participants with chronic cough compared to controls for both Capsaicin > Saline (U(54) = 212, P = 0.003) and ATP > Saline (U(54) = 229, P = 0.007; Mann–Whitney U test). Similarly, percentage BOLD signal change measured from the paratrigeminal nucleus (Fig. 5c and d) was also significantly lower in participants with chronic cough compared to controls for both Capsaicin > Saline (U(54) = 250, P = 0.001) and ATP > Saline (U(54) = 210, P = 0.003; Mann–Whitney U test). By contrast, percentage signal changes measured from both the anterior cingulate cortex and primary sensory cortex (Fig. 5e–h) were comparable for the two stimuli in both participant groups (P values ranged from P = 0.324 to P = 0.839; Mann–Whitney U test). In the midbrain, a region previously shown to demonstrate increased BOLD signal changes during capsaicin inhalation in participants with chronic cough compared to controls,20 Cough participant > Control participant contrasts revealed a cluster of activated voxels for Capsaicin > Saline in and adjacent to the periaqueductal grey (Fig. 6a). Percentage BOLD signal changes (Fig. 6b and c) extracted from this ROI were significantly higher in participants with chronic cough compared to controls for both Capsaicin > Saline (U(54) = 195, P = 0.001) and ATP > Saline (U(54) = 262, P = 0.033; Mann–Whitney U test).

Discussion

Participants with chronic cough in the present study displayed hypersensitivity to inhaled cough challenge stimuli. Thus, lower stimulus levels were needed to evoke equivalent cough behaviours in participants with chronic cough compared to control participants. However, this hypersensitivity was not represented at the level of the medullary brainstem in regions that receive incoming primary sensory inputs from the airways. Instead, BOLD signal responses in the nucleus of the solitary tract and paratrigeminal nucleus were significantly lower in participants with chronic cough compared to controls, commensurate with the lower level tussive stimuli needed to evoke equivalent behavioural responses. By contrast, despite the lower activation levels in the medulla, BOLD signal responses in higher brain cortical regions that have been shown to encode urge-to-cough sensations19,32 were not different between chronic cough and control participants, while a region in the midbrain displayed significantly greater activation in the participants with chronic cough compared to controls. These data are therefore at odds with the prevailing hypothesis of heightened responsivity of peripheral sensory neural pathways as a mechanism underlying cough hypersensitivity. Rather, hypersensitivity in cough neural pathways may involve processes that amplify incoming cough signals at more rostral levels in the central nervous system.

Cough-evoking vagal sensory neurons arise from both the nodose and jugular ganglia40 and, via their medullary termination sites, provide input to cough reflex circuits in the brainstem and urge-to-cough sensation circuits in the higher brain.12,16 Some cough-evoking sensory nerve fibres are sensitive to chemical stimuli, including a range of noxious compounds entering the respiratory passages via inspired air or aspiration and/or produced during airway inflammation.2 Preclinical studies in animals, have shown that capsaicin-sensitive airway sensory neurons exist in both the nodose and jugular vagal ganglia, the former terminating in the nucleus of the solitary tract and the latter in the paratrigeminal nucleus.10,16,40, 41, 42 With respect to ATP, complexity exists in the likely mechanism of action due to differential expression of purinergic receptor subtypes on subsets of sensory nerve fibres regulating cough. For example, in animal studies most nodose neurons respond robustly to ATP due to the large ionic currents carried by heteromeric P2X2/3 channels, whereas jugular neuron responses to ATP are modest as they lack P2X2/3, expressing only homomeric P2X3 channels which carry small desensitising currents when exposed to ATP.9,10 Consistent with this, ATP evoked cough in healthy animals is preserved when jugular ganglia pathways are disrupted through selective lesions of their recipient neurons in the brainstem.16

Clinical trial data supports an important role for ATP in chronic cough,2,13, 14, 15 although the nature of this role remains unclear. The preclinical data above would suggest that purinergic receptor antagonists reduce cough by targeting an action of ATP on nodose cough-evoking sensory neurons as jugular neurons are not readily activated by ATP. In this regard, ATP may sensitise or activate nodose neurons, leading to cough hypersensitivity and excessive coughing.2,11 However, these preclinical studies have been conducted in the absence of any pathology associated with chronic cough and it is conceivable that plasticity in purinergic receptor expression or function may alter the pattern of neural responsiveness to ATP in the disease settings.18 Indeed, individuals with chronic cough typically present with cough hypersensitivity, a syndrome characterised by excessive cough triggered by low levels of mechanical, chemical or thermal stimuli and consistent with plasticity in sensory neural function.2,3 However, we failed to see evidence for a change in medullary brainstem activation patterns that would be suggestive of a shift in the profile of sensory neuron responsivity to ATP in participants with chronic cough.

Despite the attractiveness of ATP as a key mediator causing cough hypersensitivity, the available evidence is inconsistent with this notion. For example, although the purinergic receptor antagonist Gefapixant inhibits ATP-evoked cough in individuals with RCC and UCC, it has no effect on heightened cough responses evoked by inhalation of either capsaicin or citric acid in these same people,13 arguing that ATP is not subserving the role of a generic sensitiser of cough sensory nerve fibres. This is consistent with the clinical trial data showing that P2X2/3 and P2X3 antagonists are not universally effective at reducing cough.2 Furthermore, the present data raises important questions about the role of peripheral nerve sensitisation in cough hypersensitivity and chronic cough. Our participants with chronic cough showed cough behavioural hypersensitivity to inhaled challenges for both capsaicin and ATP, resulting in significantly lower concentrations of stimuli needed to achieve comparable urge-to-cough ratings during fMRI scanning. However, BOLD signal responses in the medulla were also significantly lower in participants with chronic cough, seemingly representative of the lower stimulus concentration delivered and not the equivalent behavioural response experienced. One interpretation is that airway sensory nerve fibres activated by capsaicin and ATP are not hypersensitive to stimuli in the participants with chronic cough involved in our study, and instead stimuli like ATP may simply serve as activators of sensory neurons in some individuals. Heightened sensitivity or responsivity to these chemical stimuli may in fact manifest through processes elsewhere in the nervous system, such that even low levels of peripheral sensory inputs can be amplified or used more effectively to evoke coughing. This is consistent with existing data showing that individuals with chronic cough have a heightened Arnold nerve cough reflex, evoked by mechanical stimulation of the external auditory meatus, a site where putative airway-derived mediators of peripheral hypersensitivity are unlikely to reach and central amplification mechanisms seem more plausible.43,44 The findings are also consistent with clinical intervention studies demonstrating efficacy of cough behavioural therapy for treating RCC and UCC.45,46

The magnitude of BOLD signal responses in the primary sensory and cingulate cortical locations identified in the present study have previously been shown to correlate closely with urge-to-cough ratings during capsaicin inhalation,19,32 suggesting that they comprise part of a cortical network for encoding urge-to-cough intensity. As such, the comparable levels of neural activation in these regions of interest between control participants and participants with chronic cough, during comparable stimulus-evoked urge-to-cough experiences, are consistent with signal amplification occurring in the neural pathways at a level between the primary medullary brainstem integration sites and the higher brain. We have previously shown that regions of the midbrain encompassing the PAG and cuneiform nucleus show heightened responses in participants with chronic cough,20 and others have identified these midbrain regions as a putative site for pain sensitisation.47 In the present study we again noted that significantly more stimulus-evoked activation in the midbrain of participants with chronic cough compared to controls, in a region comparable to that in our previous study, perhaps providing further support for the midbrain acting as the cough sensory input amplifier.

Several considerations for the interpretation of our findings need to be explored. The neural processes involved in central amplification of sensory inputs in chronic cough are not known and we cannot rule out alternative processes including alterations in the sensitivity or activity of cough motor pathways or motor control systems. In this regard, a diminution of cough suppressive neural circuit activation in chronic cough has been reported.20,48, 49, 50 In the present study we noted that participants with chronic cough and controls displayed different relationships between their level of urge-to-cough experienced at their thresholds for eliciting cough responses. Thus, cough thresholds were reached in participants with chronic cough at significantly lower urge-to-cough ratings, indicative of a change in the efficacy of sensory-motor coupling in chronic cough. It is difficult to attribute this result solely to central amplification of incoming sensory signals, as one would expect both urge-to-cough and cough to shift in parallel with increasing sensitivity. Instead, a loss of central inhibition may reduce the sensory input needed to trigger coughing. It is also possible that complex changes occur in how individuals with chronic cough appraise their airway irritation. Although, it is interesting that we did not observe any significant differences in the qualitative description or location of the perceptible sensations associated with inhalation of capsaicin or ATP in control participants and participants with chronic cough, arguing that sensitisation in chronic cough is not accompanied by overt changes in these aspects of stimulus perception. Interrogation of the individual participant BOLD signal responses suggests a level of heterogeneity in regional responsivity, the cause of which is difficult to ascertain. One possibility is that anatomical organisation of functional responses in these small brainstem structures are not uniform between participants. Alternatively, different mechanisms (endotypes) leading to cough sensitisation may exist.2,51 Indeed, our findings may have been different if we investigated patients with cough and an existing lung disease (e.g., asthma) where pulmonary inflammation, and hence peripheral sensitisation, is expected. Lastly, it is important to recognise that brainstem BOLD signals may be adversely impacted by alternative sources of physiological noise which could be differentially expressed by control participants and participants with chronic cough. One of our incorporated measured estimates of baseline noise in the fMRI data was higher in cough participants, but importantly there was no systematic differential expression of increased noise associated with tussive stimulus blocks between the two groups (see Supplementary Material), suggesting that this is not a major confound in the BOLD activations reported.

In summary, the pattern of sensory neuron sensitivity to inhaled ATP does not appear to be a defining mechanism of cough hypersensitivity, at least in our participants with suspected RCC and UCC. Furthermore, our data challenges the notion that airway sensory neurons are hypersensitive in chronic cough. Instead, possible central amplifier mechanisms and losses in endogenous suppressive control systems may render the cough neural induction system in the brain more responsive to low levels of peripheral airway sensory neuron input. This finding adds to a growing body of evidence of both structural and functional plasticity in central neural networks as mechanisms underpinning cough hypersensitivity.20,52, 53, 54 Nevertheless, we cannot fully rule out the possibility that the chemically sensitive cough pathways activated by inhaled capsaicin and ATP in the present study are not the sensory pathways involved in chronic cough, even though capsaicin and ATP evoked cough and associated behaviours were hypersensitive. Furthermore, it is important to recognise that the data do not discount the therapeutic benefit of targeting peripheral sensory neuron activity in chronic cough,2 including the use of P2X3 receptor antagonists for individuals in which ATP plays a role in sensory neuron activation. However, the data do highlight the potential value of also considering centrally targeted approaches aimed at restoring normal cough circuit responsivity.

Abstract
Background

Cough is one of the most common presenting problems for patients in primary care and is largely managed in primary care clinical settings. Family physicians’ familiarity with chronic cough guidelines and the extent to which these guidelines translate into everyday practice have not been well described. The objective of this study was to characterize current diagnosis, treatment, and referral practices among family physicians and to identify potentially impactful strategies to optimize chronic cough management in primary care.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 5,000 family physicians to explore diagnosis, treatment, and referral practices related to chronic cough management in adults in primary care. Respondents completed the survey via paper or online. The outcome measures were self-reported numeric ratings and responses related to the survey elements.

Results

588 surveys were completed (11.8% response rate). About half (49.6%) of respondents defined chronic cough in a manner consistent with the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) chronic cough guidelines, with the rest differing in opinion primarily regarding duration of symptom presentation. Respondents reported trying to rule out most common causes of chronic cough themselves before referring (mean 3.41 on a 4-point scale where 4 is “describes me completely”) and indicated a desire for more resources to help them manage and treat chronic cough. Years in practice and rural/urban setting influenced diagnosis and referral practices.

Conclusions

Family physicians see chronic cough as a complicated condition that can be and is often diagnosed and treated entirely in a primary care setting. They also value the ability to refer in complex cases. Our results support that family physicians provide evidence-based management of chronic cough.

Background

Cough is one of the most common presenting symptoms for patients in primary care and is a driver of referrals to secondary specialist care in the US and worldwide [1–4]. Chronic cough is more common in Europe, America, and Australia than in Asia than in other countries [5]. Cough lasting longer than eight weeks is considered chronic [1–3, 6–12] and has a prevalence of about 10% among adults in the United States [4, 9, 13, 14]. In a 2018 survey of US adults with chronic cough, 92% of respondents had visited a healthcare clinician in the prior six months, with the most (72%) visiting general and family practitioners [15].

Chronic cough can be a symptom of various diseases, and some physicians argue that, in some cases, it can be considered a respiratory condition in and of itself [9, 16]. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommends a diagnosis algorithm based on patient history and examination and categorizes cough by duration: <3 weeks is considered acute; 3–8 weeks is subacute; and > 8 weeks is considered chronic [1, 7, 10–12]. The ACCP guidelines have been adopted by several different specialties and have been endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) for use in family medicine and primary care [12].

Importantly, chronic cough can result in problems beyond respiratory symptoms, creating a wide variety of challenges for the patient seeking treatment. Disturbed sleep, fatigue, and urinary incontinence – particularly among female patients – can impact the mental health and overall quality of life of those with chronic cough. Severe cases may lead to vomiting, muscle pain, rib fractures, and syncope, as well as embarrassment and social discomfort, particularly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, making the patient feel stigmatized [7, 12, 17, 18].

Considering the prevalence of chronic cough and its extensive presentation and management in primary care, evidence-based assessment and treatment strategies must align with the needs of front-line primary care clinicians and their patients. Although much of the literature around chronic cough management is focused on other specialty settings, it is important to understand the current practices and needs of primary care clinicians regarding their important role in the front lines of effectively diagnosing and managing chronic cough. Here, we explored chronic cough diagnosis, treatment, and referral practices reported by family physicians to inform how best to support primary care clinicians and their patients in chronic cough management. We also examined how physician characteristics and practice context may influence management of chronic cough and self-reported educational needs.

Methods
Study design

This project was a cross-sectional survey of family physicians that was administered by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) National Research Network (NRN) from December 19, 2020, through March 19, 2021. The survey was sent to a random sample of 5,000 US-based family physician members of AAFP who were currently engaged in clinical practice for at least 50% of their professional time and cared for adult patients. Family physicians residing in Vermont were excluded due to state regulations. Respondents were compensated $10 for their time.

The survey was administered online using Qualtrics (Provo, Utah), with paper surveys mailed to those who did not respond to the initial emailed survey invitation. Personalized links were emailed through the AAFP blast email system. Two reminders were sent to non-responders at two-week intervals, and a paper survey was mailed to all non-responders two weeks after the first email invitation. Data collection concluded three months following initial contact.

Survey instrument

The survey was developed for this study in consultation with a panel of subject matter experts consisting of six family physicians, three allergy/immunologists, and one pulmonologist [see Additional File 1 for survey instrument]. These experts identified key variables of interest and relevance to management of chronic cough, such as defining, diagnosing, and treating chronic cough; the when and how of referring chronic cough patients to specialists; and educational needs related to chronic cough. All experts contributed to development and review of survey items. The final draft survey was pilot tested by the family physicians on the expert panel for clarity and ease of completion and was refined further with their feedback. The survey included questions on demographic characteristics of both the respondent and their practice as well as questions with Likert-type response options regarding how they characterize chronic cough prior to being provided a definition; the usefulness of various indicators and diagnostics when evaluating and diagnosing chronic cough; and how they would rank several problems that patients with chronic cough report as reasons for seeking care, Numerical values were assigned to Likert-type response options to create ordinal data for each question, allowing for calculation of means and standard deviations for responses for each question. See table footnotes for each specific variable for responses associated with numerical values.

Data cleaning, statistics, and analytical methods

Completed paper surveys were scanned via a Fujitsu FI-6770 scanner and checked for accuracy. Data from paper and online surveys were merged into one combined dataset and checked to ensure data quality and completeness. Duplicates were removed, with paper survey responses used if both surveys were completed. Descriptive statistics were prepared for all questions. All available data was used, assuming ignorable missingness (missing completely at random, MCAR). For MCAR, pairwise deletion (i.e., all available data are used, leading to different samples for each question) was used when reporting on all included results. For the initial analyses, Student’s/Welch’s t-tests, ANOVAs (ANalysis of VAriance), and ANCOVAs (ANalysis of CoVAriance) were used for inferential statistics and focusing on the overall variables/values. Using the results of the initial analyses, we identified specific demographic variables for further analysis. For ANOVAs and ANCOVAs, post-hoc tests were completed for significant overall results to determine possible differences between the pairs of categories. Tukey’s HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) was used when there was homogeneity in the variance, and Games-Howell was used when homogeneity in the variance was violated. Statistical testing was two-sided with alpha = 0.05 and p-values reported. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25 (Armonk, NY).

Results
Demographics

A total of 588 (11.8%) respondents completed surveys, with 410 (69.7%) of the respondents completing on paper and 178 (30.3%) online (Table 1). These numbers are in line with other survey studies we have completed [19–23]). The majority of the respondents were born in 1970 or later (54.2%), female (52.8%), not Hispanic or Latinx (91.8%), white (74.4%), out of residency for 16 or more years (51.5%), spent 76–99% of their clinical time with adults (54.8%), and worked in an urban setting (84.4%). The respondents worked for a variety of employers including private non-profit hospital or health system (32.0%), physician group (19.3%), or for themselves (18.1%). The respondents had similar characteristic distributions as the overall AAFP membership: average age and rurality were almost equal, our sample has slightly more females and skews older than the AAFP membership [24].

Descriptive survey findings
Definition of chronic cough

Prior to being presented with a definition, most respondents indicated that a chronic cough should last 8 or more weeks (84.2%), be persistent on most days (66.0%), and have a noticeable effect on a patient’s daily life (54.0%) (Table 2). Phlegm/sputum were not considered relevant for defining chronic cough (98.5%). Respondents were then presented with the definition of chronic cough as a cough that lasts 8 weeks or longer, and the majority agreed or strongly agreed with this definition (77.2%; Table 2).

Chronic cough evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment

Respondents rated the following items useful for evaluation and diagnosis (in order of mean score from most to least useful (Table 3)): smoking status, medication history [especially angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs], exposure to environmental irritants, spirometry if asthma is suspected, and pulmonary function studies. For treatment, “trial of other medication” was considered useful, higher than the two medications listed on the survey: pregabalin and gabapentin (Table 3). The “other medication” category included medications sometimes used for treatment such as proton pump inhibitors, inhaled corticosteroids, inhalers, antihistamine, allergy meds, cough suppressant, and gastroesophageal reflux disorder medications (not shown).

Referral to specialty care

Family physicians indicated at least sometimes referring chronic cough patients to specialists. In order of most to least, patients were referred to pulmonologists, allergists, otorhinolaryngologists, and gastroenterologists (Table 4). Referrals to other specialties were less frequent. Most respondents indicated conducting their evaluation in phases and assessing for and ruling out most common causes of chronic cough before referral to a specialist. They reported assessing and treating for upper airway cough syndrome first, and their responses indicated they follow ACCP guidelines. Notably, respondents indicated little identification with the statement, “I refer all or most patients with chronic cough to a specialist for full evaluation” (Table 4).

Perceptions of patient experience

Respondents indicated “patient cannot tolerate it anymore” and “patient concern that it is cancer or something serious” as the first and second most common reason patients with chronic cough sought care, respectively (Table 4). Respondents also indicated their perceptions of how frequently patients with chronic cough report physical and social challenges related to their cough symptoms, such as incontinence or stigma that cough may be due to COVID-19 (Table 4).

Results of statistical analyses

Two demographic characteristics emerged as variables related to differences in responses: rurality (rural or urban) and years since residency (0, 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, or more than 20 years). Only significant results for each category are presented below (Table 5).

Definition

When provided with the ACCP definition that “chronic cough is a cough that lasts eight weeks or longer in adults,” the respondents located in urban areas agreed to a lesser extent with the definition than the respondents located in rural areas (Table 5).

Diagnosis and treatment

For diagnosis, two strategies differed significantly in uptake: chest radiography/chest x-ray and allergy assessments. There was a significant difference among groups of respondents with differing years since residency (no significant Tukey HSD Post Hoc Tests; Table 5) for the respondents who used chest radiography/chest x-ray as part of evaluating and diagnosing chronic cough, with increasing experience corresponding to increased uptake of chest radiography/chest x-ray. After controlling for respondents’ urban or rural location, respondents with more years since residency were still more likely to use chest radiography/chest x-ray than respondents with fewer years since residency (no significant Tukey HSD Post Hoc Tests; Table 5). There was also a significant difference in the use of allergy assessments among respondent groups with differing years since residency. Those who were 11–15 years since residency were more likely to include allergy assessments as part of their diagnostics and testing for chronic cough than those in 1–5 years post-residency (Table 5).

Referral

There was a significant difference in the use of Behavioral Therapy among respondent groups with differing years since residency (Table 5). For the Tukey HSD Post Hoc Tests, the group with more than 20 years since residency was more likely to refer to behavioral therapy than the group with 11–15 years since residency.

While the respondents located in urban settings were more likely than respondents located in rural settings to indicate they refer to a specialist for full evaluation (Table 5), respondents located in urban areas indicated they had more confidence than the respondents located in rural areas in evaluating and treating chronic cough. While controlling for respondents’ years since residency, respondents located in urban settings were still more likely than respondents located in rural settings to indicate they refer to a specialist for full evaluation (Table 5).

Discussion

Treatment guidelines for family physicians take multiple factors into account when defining and diagnosing chronic cough, such as duration, frequency, impact on daily life, and results of clinical and empirical assessments [12]. Interestingly, while we found that half of the family physician respondents to our survey apply the ACCP definition of longer than 8 weeks in duration [1–3, 6–12], one-third reported using three months (Table 2). Further exploration into the use of a longer duration may shed light into the clinical insights used by family physicians in determining when to consider cough chronic. In addition to considering cough duration, family physician respondents take patient-centered factors into account such as number of days per week that a patient coughs and the impact of cough on daily life such as sleep disruption, urinary incontinence, and impact on family members. These considerations are consistent with literature describing the primary reasons patients seek medical care for chronic cough [7, 12, 17, 18].

Our findings support that chronic cough is largely managed within primary care without referral with respondents indicating a preference to treat most chronic cough patients themselves whenever possible, as is supported by other studies [4, 9]. Consistent with this finding and prior studies, we found that primary care physicians refer patients with chronic cough after exhausting resources at their disposal [12, 14]. It is important to note that survey respondents reported that many if not most chronic cough patients are being managed by family physicians in primary care and that, for those referred to other specialists, family physicians continue to manage the comprehensive care for these patients. Studies examining chronic cough may need to differentiate between those patients managed effectively in primary care and those requiring management in collaboration with other specialists.

Here, we show that family physicians are comfortable managing chronic cough because they reported a general understanding of the most common causes of and treatments for chronic cough, consistent with existing recommendations [8–10, 12]. Interestingly, despite comfort with managing and treating chronic cough themselves and adherence to appropriate guidelines, only a minority agreed or strongly agreed that they were confident in their abilities to evaluate and treat this condition. This apparent lack of confidence suggests a potential need for education to validate and confirm family physician knowledge about chronic cough management strategies. It may also help explain why we found that family physicians value the ability to refer as an important tool in chronic cough management.

Years of experience since residency related to differential approaches to both diagnosis and referral for chronic cough. These differences, specifically for chest x-rays, allergy assessments, and referrals to behavioral therapy (Table 5), may have been influenced by differing training experiences and evolving clinical guidance during both residency and years in practice [25, 26]. Understanding and addressing difference in practice that may result from timing of training could inform a framework for ensuring up-to-date continuing medical education is available to promote current best practices.

Referral to other specialists was influenced by rural/urban practice location. Rural physicians reported referring less often and indicated less satisfaction with the availability of specialists in their area. Interestingly, rural physicians reported having less confidence in evaluating and treating chronic cough than those in urban areas, possibly the result of having to manage more complex cases without referral (Table 5). This is consistent with the American Board of Family Medicine’s finding that overall, rural family physicians have a broader scope of practice than urban physicians, likely due to less overall infrastructure support which may include fewer referral options [27]. This study was not designed to focus on the matter of rural specialist availability, but our findings suggest the need for further exploration of whether/how rural physicians manage chronic cough differently than those in urban areas.

Limitations

There are several limitations inherent with survey research that should be noted. Non-response bias can be an issue with any voluntary survey and can limit the generalizability of results, and risk for bias can be greater with lower response rates. While the sample of 5,000 is unlikely to create issues due to random error, the response rate of 11.8% carries with it a risk of non-random error. There may be differences between practices and perspectives of family physicians who completed the survey and those who chose not to complete it. In addition, self-report of behaviors comes with its own limitations, as can recall bias. We worked to develop a survey that is unambiguous and elicits reliable results, but we also cannot discount the possibility of a degree of bias from subjective perceptions. It should also be noted that this is a US-based survey, so the results may not be applicable to physicians outside the United States.

Conclusions

Family physicians use multiple factors to determine when a cough is chronic, but when prompted, generally agree with the ACCP guidelines of longer than 8 weeks. Family physicians prefer to treat chronic cough themselves and report a patient-centered approach to caring for patients with chronic cough, including referral to specialists (particularly pulmonologists) when appropriate. Family physicians in rural contexts tended to report referring less often, possibly reflecting their adaptation to a need for a broader scope of practice in rural primary care. Overall, family physicians report providing evidenced-based management of chronic cough.

Abstract
Background

Voice problems have been reported in individuals with chronic cough, but population-based prevalence data are not yet available. While both conditions independently affect health and sick leave, their combined effects have not been studied. This study investigated the prevalence of voice problems in individuals with chronic cough and whether a cough duration of over 10 years is associated with a higher prevalence. Additionally, the relationship between chronic cough, voice problems, general health, and sick leave was explored.

Method

Cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the Respiratory Health In Northern Europe, RHINE III (n = 7,372) and RHINE IV (n = 10,101) surveys were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to analyze associations between chronic cough, voice problems, general health, and sick leave.

Results

Voice problems were reported by 30% of individuals with dry cough and 51% with productive cough, compared to 17% without cough. Among those with dry cough, prevalence increased from 24% (< 10 years) to 37% (> 10 years), with no significant difference for productive cough. Poor health was reported by 7.5% with dry cough and voice problems, 10% with productive cough and voice problems, and 1.7% without either condition. Chronic cough and voice problems were independently associated with poorer health, with an additive effect when co-occurring (adjusted Odds Ratio (95% CI): Dry cough 1.78 (1.34–2.37), Productive cough 2.03 (1.56–2.63), Voice problems 1.73 (1.54–1.94)). Chronic cough, but not voice problems, was linked to increased sick leave.

Conclusion

Voice problems are common among individuals with chronic cough, especially in productive cough. Both chronic cough and voice problems are independently associated with poorer general health, with additive effects when co-occurring. Chronic cough, but not voice problems, was associated with more sick leave. These findings highlight the need to address the combined burden of chronic cough and voice problems to improve patient outcomes and well-being.

Introduction

Chronic cough affects approximately 10% of the adult population and is typically defined as a cough lasting more than eight weeks [1, 2]. It can persist for several years, with more than 40% still experiencing symptoms after five years [3]. Patients attending specialist clinics with complaints of chronic cough are predominantly women over the age of 50 [4].

In patients with chronic cough, the cough can manifest as either dry or productive (coughing up phlegm) and both types of cough can be associated with several lung diseases or can be idiopathic [1, 5]. The type of cough seems to reflect somewhat different clinical cohorts with different demographics and comorbidities [6, 7]. Chronic cough is often difficult to treat and can have a considerable impact on both mental and physical health [8–10], and has also been found to decrease work productivity and increase the number of sick leave days [6, 10, 11].

Self-reported voice problems, including symptoms such as vocal fatigue, vocal strain, and hoarseness, as well as measurable deviations in voice function have been reported in several studies on chronic cough [12–16]. In clinical studies on patients with chronic cough, up to 75% have reported voice symptoms, and dysphonia has been found in up to 40% [12, 17]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no population-based studies available on the prevalence of voice problems in individuals with chronic cough.

The cause of voice problems in chronic cough is unclear. Unexplained chronic cough is believed to result from increased sensitivity of the sensory nerves in the airways, a view that is also supported by the European Respiratory Society Task Force [18]. It has been suggested that the voice problems in individuals with chronic cough might be caused by a similar mechanism involving heightened laryngeal sensitivity [14, 19, 20]. This laryngeal hypersensitivity may contribute not only to cough, but also to increased laryngeal muscle tension and conditions such as inducible laryngeal obstruction, which in turn can lead to voice problems [14, 20]. Several factors have been proposed as potential triggers of this laryngeal sensory dysfunction, including viral infections, and gastroesophageal reflux, all of which may amplify laryngeal sensitivity and contribute to the development of both cough and voice symptoms [21].

Airway disease, including asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are also known risk factors for developing voice problems [22–24]. These conditions are also frequently linked to chronic cough [1, 5]. The cough itself might also result in voice problems by causing trauma to the vocal fold epithelium [25]. In long-term chronic cough, repeated vocal fold trauma might cause lesions, potentially leading to an increase in voice symptoms.

Voice problems may have a negative impact on quality of life and general health [26] and have been reported to increase the number of sick leave days [27]. However, it is unclear how general health and sick leave is affected when chronic cough and voice problems co-occur.

The main aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of voice problems in chronic cough in a general, North European population, and to determine whether a cough duration longer than 10 years is associated with a higher prevalence of voice problems compared to a shorter duration of cough. The association between voice problems in chronic cough, sick leave, and self-perceived general health was also explored.

Method

The present study is both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal multicenter study based on data from the cohort study “Respiratory Health in Northern Europe” (RHINE) III and IV [28]. RHINE is a collaboration between seven Northern European centers: Aarhus (Denmark); Umea, Gothenburg, and Uppsala (Sweden); Bergen (Norway); Reykjavik (Iceland); and Tartu (Estonia). Since 1990, a random population sample (n = 21,802), born between 1945 and 1973, has completed questionnaires, with follow-ups every ten years. The population sample was originally derived from the participants in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) [29]. Data collection for RHINE III was conducted from 2010 to 2012, and for RHINE IV from 2020 to 2023.

RHINE includes questions about respiratory symptoms and diseases, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, employment, and sick leave. In RHINE IV, a question about voice problems was also included. The questionnaire is publicly available and can be accessed online [28]. The study protocol has previously been described elsewhere [6, 30].

Data from RHINE IV were used for cross-sectional analyses, with 10,101 individuals completing the questionnaire. To examine whether a cough duration over 10 years increased the prevalence of voice problems, longitudinal data with responses from 7,372 participants who answered cough-related questions in both RHINE III and RHINE IV, as well as the question about voice problems in RHINE IV, were analyzed.

The RHINE study received approval from the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics in compliance with national legislation. All participants gave informed consent prior to participation in each study wave.

Chronic cough

Chronic cough was defined as a positive answer to the question “In recent years, have you been troubled by a protracted cough?” Participants who also gave a positive answer to the question “Do you usually bring up phlegm or do you have phlegm in your lungs which you have difficulty bringing up?” were considered to have productive cough, while the participants with a negative answer were considered to have dry cough. The same definition was used in a previous study [6]. In the present study, the term “cough” specifically refers to chronic cough. Acute or intermittent cough is not evaluated.

Voice problems

The occurrence of voice problems was evaluated with a question previously used in a public health study examining the prevalence of voice problems in a Swedish cohort [31]. The question read “Does your voice tire, strain, or get hoarse when you talk? Disregard symptoms that depend on current cold or upper-airway infection. The voice symptoms may vary but try to estimate an average”, with the response options: 1 = No; 2 = Yes, to a small extent; 3 = Yes, to a great extent. Due to the small number of participants reporting voice problems to a great extent, all individuals who reported voice problems to any extent were combined into a single category for most analyses. However, in the analyses of sick leave, participants with voice problems were also analyzed based on the extent of their symptoms.

Chronic cough duration (< 10 years/> 10 years)

Participants with a chronic cough duration exceeding 10 years were classified based on their responses in the RHINE III and RHINE IV surveys. If they reported any cough in RHINE III and a dry cough in RHINE IV, they were categorized as having dry cough > 10 years. Conversely, if they reported any cough in RHINE III and a productive cough in RHINE IV, they were categorized as having productive cough > 10 years. Participants who reported any cough in RHINE III but no cough in RHINE IV were classified as having a chronic cough duration < 10 years.

General health

General health was evaluated with the question “In general, how would you rate your overall health?” with the options 1 = Excellent; 2 = Very good; 3 = Good; 4 = Fair; 5 = Poor. Responses were categorized into three groups for the unadjusted analysis: (1) Excellent and very good; (2) Good and fair; (3) Poor.

Sick leave

The analysis of sick leave was conducted on participants currently working, defined as reporting being employed or self-employed in response to the question “What term best describes your current work situation?”. A total of 9,823 individuals answered the question, of whom 5,920 were currently working and therefore eligible for the analysis of sick leave. Due to missing data on cough, voice problems, and/or sick leave, the final sample size for this analysis was 5,588 participants. Sick leave was evaluated with a question about the number of sick leave days in the previous 12 months with the following response options: 0 = 0 days; 1 = 1–7; 2 = 8–30; 3 = 31–90; 4 = 91–365 days. The responses were categorized into three groups for the unadjusted analysis: (1) No sick leave days; (2) 1–7 days; (3) more than 7 days.

Confounders

Confounders were identified by using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) including variables that previous research has identified as potential confounders of the association between chronic cough (exposure) and voice problems (outcome) (See Additional file 1). The confounders identified were study center, sex, age, BMI, educational level, cardiovascular disease, asthma, CRS, COPD, nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux (nGER), smoking history, and current anxiety and/or depression. Sex and age were self-reported, and BMI was calculated from self-reported weight and height (kg/m2). Educational level was derived from RHINE III and participants were categorized into three levels of education: elementary school, high school and college/university. Cardiovascular disease was defined as a positive answer to the question “Have you ever had a stroke?” and/or the question “Have you ever been treated in hospital because of heart infarction or angina pectoris?” Asthma was defined as an affirmative answer to the question “Have you had an attack of asthma in the last 12 months?” and/or an affirmative answer to the question “Are you currently taking any medicine (including inhalers, aerosols, or tablets) for asthma?”, in line with definitions used in previous studies [6, 32]. CRS was defined as the occurrence of a minimum of 2 of the following symptoms for ≥ 12 weeks in the past year; nasal obstruction, pain/pressure in the upper facial region, nasal secretion, or reduced/absent smell [6]. COPD was defined as an affirmative answer to the question “Has a doctor ever told you that you have COPD?”. nGER was characterized as the occurrence of heartburn or belching once a week or more while in a supine position. Information about smoking history was obtained from the questions “Are you a smoker (this applies even if you only smoke the odd cigarette/cigar or pipe every week)?” and “Are you an ex-smoker?”. Participants were categorized as either never, former, or current smokers based on the answers to these questions. Current anxiety/depression was defined as an affirmative answer to one or both of these questions: “Do you currently receive treatment for depression?” and “Do you currently receive treatment for anxiety?”. Asthma, COPD, CRS, and nGER were identified as comorbidities associated with voice problems and chronic cough based on previous research. The prevalence of these conditions combined was calculated across subgroups defined by chronic cough presence and type, as well as voice problem status.

Statistical analysis

Stata 17 (StataCorp LLC, Texas, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize and describe the characteristics of the participants in the overall cohort as well as in the different subgroups with and without chronic cough and voice problems. The association between voice problems and chronic cough, as well as long-term chronic cough, was analyzed using the Chi-squared test. Logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounders and to conduct stratified analyses. The association of chronic cough and voice problems with general health were assessed using ordered logistic regression with the original response options on general health. For sick leave, logistic regression was performed with participants divided into two groups, those with 7 or fewer days of sick leave, and those with more than 7 days in the previous 12 months. Voice and chronic cough parameters were analyzed as separate independent variables in these regression models. Interaction terms between voice problems and cough type were included to assess whether the effect of voice problems on health and sick leave outcomes varied by the presence of cough. To evaluate the effect of sex and asthma on the outcome, the same regression models were performed, stratified by sex and asthma. The results were presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Data are presented as % or mean ± Standard Deviation (SD). BMI: Body Mass Index; COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; CRS: Chronic Rhinosinusitis; nGER: Nocturnal Gastroesophageal Reflux; #: any of current asthma, COPD, CRS and/or nGER. Data on voice problems were missing for 130 participants in the no-cough group, 12 in the dry cough group, and 12 in the productive cough group

Among participants with dry cough, 30% reported voice problems and among those with productive cough, the prevalence was 51%. In comparison, 17% of participants without chronic cough reported voice problems, and in the total sample, 20% experienced voice problems. The difference between the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons) (Table 1).

Voice problems were generally more common among women, with the highest female proportion among participants with dry chronic cough and voice problems. A higher proportion of former smokers was observed among participants with voice problems, irrespective of cough status (Table 1).

Those reporting voice problems were more likely to also report asthma compared to participants without voice problems, irrespective of cough status. COPD, CRS, nGER, and anxiety/depression were also more prevalent among those with voice problems, with the highest proportion in participants also experiencing productive cough (Table 1).

The association between voice problems and chronic cough persisted after adjusting for confounders. Individuals with dry cough had 1.68 times the odds of experiencing voice problems compared to those without cough, the corresponding number for those with productive cough was 2.80 (Table 2).

Three analyses were conducted: (1) total sample analysis (2) stratified by sex (male and females), and (3) stratified by current asthma (current self-reported asthma vs. no asthma). Total sample analysis was adjusted for study center, sex, age, BMI, educational level, smoking history, cardiovascular disease, current asthma, COPD, CRS, nGER and current anxiety/depression, and stratified analyses on sex and asthma were adjusted for the same confounders excluding sex and asthma respectively. Results are presented as OR; 95% CI

When stratified by sex, dry cough was significantly correlated with voice problems only in women, while productive cough showed significant correlations in both sexes. Stratification by asthma showed that productive chronic cough, but not dry chronic cough, was significantly correlated with voice problems in participants with self-reported asthma. Among those without asthma, both dry and productive chronic cough were correlated with voice problems (Table 2).

Chronic cough duration (< 10 years/ >10 years) and voice problems

Participants who reported a chronic cough duration exceeding 10 years had a higher prevalence of voice problems compared to those with a shorter duration of cough, with the biggest difference in prevalence seen in participants with dry cough. For participants with a dry cough lasting less than 10 years, 24% reported voice problems, which increased to 37% among those with a dry cough lasting more than 10 years. Among participants with productive cough, 47% of those with a cough duration under 10 years experienced voice problems, with a slight increase to 53% for those whose cough exceeded 10 years. The difference in prevalence was significant for dry cough (p = 0.003) but not for productive cough (p = 0.13). This remained largely unchanged after adjusting for confounding factors (Fig. 1).

Logistic regression models assessing the association between cough type (dry vs. productive) and cough duration (< 10 years vs. >10 years) with the occurrence of voice problems. Two analyses were conducted: (1) stratified by sex (males and females), and (2) stratified by current asthma (current self-reported asthma vs. no asthma). Adjusted for study center, sex, age, BMI, educational level, smoking history, cardiovascular disease, current asthma, COPD, CRS, nGER, current anxiety/depression, excluding sex for analysis 1 and asthma for analysis 2. Results are presented as OR; 95% CI

When stratified by sex, dry chronic cough was significantly correlated with voice problems in women regardless of cough duration, and in men only in those with more than 10 years of cough. Productive cough was significantly correlated with voice problems in both sexes, regardless of cough length (Table 3).

Self-rated general health

Voice problems were associated with decreased self-reported general health. Participants with voice problems and chronic cough more often reported poor health, compared to participants without both cough and voice problems (Fig. 2).

Percent values above ten are rounded to the nearest whole number, while values below ten are rounded to one decimal place. Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding

In an adjusted analysis, individuals with voice problems had 1.73-fold increased odds of reporting lower general health compared to those without voice problems. Dry cough and productive cough were also associated with poorer reported general health (dry cough: adj. OR 1.78; productive cough: adj OR 2.03). The results were consistent when stratified by sex and self-reported asthma (Table 4). An interaction analysis revealed that the effects of voice problems and chronic cough on general health were independent of each other, although the effect of voice problems was weaker among those with productive cough (p = 0.002).

Sick leave

A higher proportion of participants with chronic cough alone or chronic cough combined with voice problems had been on sick leave for more than 7 days during the last year compared to participants without these issues (Fig. 3).

For participants with dry cough, there was no difference in sick leave between those with and without voice problems. However, among participants with productive cough, a greater percentage of participants with both productive cough and voice problems reported more than 7 days of sick leave compared to those with productive cough alone (Fig. 3).

When adjusting for confounders, no association was found between voice problems and sick leave exceeding 7 days. When analyzing the degree of voice problems separately, the odds ratio for voice problems to a great extent was 1.34 (95% CI: 0.77–2.31, p = 0.296) (Table 5). Both dry cough and productive cough were significantly associated with an increase in sick leave days. An interaction analysis examining the combined effects of voice problems and chronic cough on sick leave did not reveal any significant interactions (Table 5).

Discussion

In this population-based study of individuals aged 48–76 years, a high prevalence of self-reported voice problems among those with chronic cough was found: Approximately one-third of participants with dry chronic cough and half of those with productive chronic cough reported voice problems, compared to less than one-fifth of those without cough. Participants with dry chronic cough lasting over 10 years were significantly more likely to report voice problems compared to those with a shorter duration of cough. These associations remained also after adjusting for confounding factors.

Chronic cough and voice problems were independently associated with reported poorer general health, a pattern that persisted after adjusting for confounding factors and was not influenced by comorbid asthma or sex. There was, however, no clear association between self-reported voice problems and an increased number of sick leave days.

Prevalence of voice problems in participants with chronic cough

To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first population-based study examining the prevalence of self-reported voice problems among individuals with chronic cough. Previous studies on voice problems in chronic cough have primarily focused on clinical cohorts, reporting prevalence rates between 40% and 75%, without differentiating between dry or productive chronic cough [12, 13, 16, 17]. In the present study, a higher prevalence of voice problems was observed among individuals with productive chronic cough, with approximately half experiencing voice problems, compared to about 30% of those with dry cough. This difference suggests that distinct underlying mechanisms might contribute to voice problems in these groups. For instance, smoking history and respiratory-related comorbidities, such as COPD, asthma and CRS appeared more common in individuals with productive chronic cough and voice problems, indicating that differences in airway function could influence the likelihood of developing voice problems. Although studies comparing individuals with dry and productive chronic cough have shown mixed results regarding differences in demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities [6, 7, 33, 34], the present study suggests that differences in comorbidities and frequency of voice problems may distinguish these groups.

In the current study, 17% of participants without cough reported voice problems, while the prevalence in the total cohort was 20%. In the general adult population, the prevalence of self-reported voice problems varies, from approximately 6–40%, depending on definition, study method, and demographic factors [27, 31, 35, 36]. A Swedish study (n 74,351), which used the same question regarding voice problems as in the current study, reported a prevalence of approximately 17% among adults aged 18–104 years [31]. In the present study, participants ranged in age from their late forties to late seventies, which may account for the slightly higher prevalence observed, as voice problems are more common in older adults [31, 37].

Among participants with voice problems, self-reported asthma was more common compared to those without voice problems, with the highest proportion observed in individuals with both productive chronic cough and voice problems. This suggests that asthma is an important contributing factor to the development of voice problems, regardless of the presence of chronic cough. Asthma is a known risk factor for developing voice problems, likely due to a combination of airway inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and the effects of inhaled corticosteroids commonly used in asthma management [24, 38]. Inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO), a condition that can mimic or coexist with asthma (and is sometimes misdiagnosed as asthma), may also contribute to voice problems [39]. These overlapping mechanisms may help explain the observed loss of significant association between dry chronic cough and voice problems, when stratifying by asthma. This suggests that asthma-related factors, such as airway changes, treatment side-effects, or coexisting laryngeal dysfunction, may have a more pronounced influence on vocal health than dry chronic cough alone.

In the present study, dry chronic cough lasting longer than 10 years was associated with higher odds of voice problems compared to a shorter duration of cough. A potential explanation for this finding could be the repeated trauma to the vocal folds caused by prolonged coughing, which may lead to vocal fold edema, irritation or the development of lesions [25]. However, a study by Adessa, et al. [40] found no difference in the prevalence of benign vocal fold lesions between individuals with longer or shorter cough durations, suggesting that additional mechanisms beyond vocal fold lesions may be responsible. One possibility is that prolonged coughing maintains or exacerbates an underlying laryngeal hypersensitivity, which over time may contribute to increased laryngeal muscle tension and the development of voice problems. Laryngeal hypersensitivity has been proposed as an underlying mechanism for both voice problems and chronic cough itself [14, 19, 20].

Compared to dry chronic cough, the odds of experiencing voice problems in participants with productive cough did not increase with a cough duration over 10 years. The reason for this difference remains unclear. However, individuals with productive chronic cough were found to have higher odds of voice problems compared to those with dry cough regardless of cough duration. Factors such as smoking and conditions like COPD, chronic bronchitis, and bronchiectasis, more often linked to productive chronic cough, may contribute to this increased susceptibility by affecting both laryngeal structures and respiratory function [23, 41]. In the present study, comorbidities such as COPD, asthma, CRS, and nGER were more frequently reported among participants with productive chronic cough and voice problems. These conditions may have contributed to the elevated odds of voice problems in this group. However, since productive cough remained associated with voice problems also after adjusting for these conditions, it appears to have an independent effect on voice problems.

Self-rated general health and sick leave

Both voice problems and chronic cough are independently known to impact various health domains [8, 26]. In the current study, voice problems and chronic cough were independently associated with decreased general health, regardless of all identified confounding factors. Moreover, the combination of voice problems and chronic cough had an additive effect on decreased general health, with the lowest general health reported by the group with voice problems and productive chronic cough. While the interaction analysis indicated that the association between voice problems and general health was slightly weaker in those with productive cough, this association remained significant. In a clinical study including 430 participants, DeVore, et al. [42] also found negative effects of self-reported voice problems on general health, using a similar question as in the current study. Additionally, studies on chronic cough have confirmed the health burden associated with the condition [8, 9]. The fact that the co-occurrence of chronic cough and voice problems has a stronger association with decreased general health underscores the importance for healthcare providers involved in chronic cough care to recognize and address symptoms of voice problems in these patients. Additionally, there is a critical need to develop treatment strategies that can positively impact both chronic cough and voice problems.

The present study found no association between self-reported voice problems and sick leave exceeding 7 days, whereas an association was observed for both chronic cough groups, consistent with previous studies [6, 10]. The lack of association for voice problems is somewhat unexpected, given earlier findings of increased sick leave among individuals with voice problems, particularly in voice-demanding occupations (such as teachers, early childhood educators, and telemarketers) [27, 43–45]. However, occupational data were not available in this study, which may have limited the ability to detect such effects.

Previous studies have often assessed voice-related sick leave specifically [27, 43, 45], while the present study used a general question about sick leave for any reason. This broader approach may have diluted any potential association. Moreover, earlier research has shown that more severe voice problems are associated with an increased number of sick leave days [45]. In this study, the majority of participants reported mild voice problems, and only a small proportion reported voice problems to a great extent. The small size of this subgroup may have limited the ability to detect an association. Although the estimates suggested somewhat higher odds of sick leave among those with voice problems to a great extent, the association was not statistically significant. Mild voice problems may not lead to extended absence, particularly in less voice-demanding occupations, and may be managed through brief voice rest or workplace accommodations. In the present study, participants with voice problems were more likely to report having changed jobs due to breathing problems potentially reflecting a shift to a less vocally demanding occupation, thereby reducing the need for sick leave.

The fact that the present study found an association between chronic cough and an increase in sick leave days that were not found in participants with voice problems could be due to several factors. For example, sleep disturbances, decreased physical ability, depression, pain, and fatigue might be more common in individuals with chronic cough than with voice problems, leading to an increased risk of sick leave in this group [8–10].

Strengths and weaknesses

A key strength of the current study is its multicenter design, including seven study centers from Northern Europe. This design, along with a large general population cohort, enhances the relevance of the findings to the population within the included age group in Northern Europe. Another strength is that voice problems were evaluated with a validated question that has previously been used to assess the prevalence of voice problems in a Swedish cohort [31].

Some methodological limitations need to be addressed. In the present study, the definition of chronic cough did not correspond to the typical clinical definition of a cough lasting longer than 8 weeks. This lack of a specific time frame may have led to classification errors affecting the prevalence of chronic cough. However, the definition used here has been shown to identify a similar or slightly higher prevalence of chronic cough as previous studies [6]. Additionally, since long-term chronic cough was defined as self-reported chronic cough at two discrete time points, it cannot be determined whether participants experienced symptoms consistently throughout the interval, which might have influenced the observed association between long-term cough and voice problems.

In this study, participants who reported voice problems to a small extent and to a great extent were combined into a single category of “voice problems”. This was done due to the low number of participants reporting problems to a great extent, leading to significantly reduced statistical power if analyzed separately. However, previous studies have shown that even mild voice problems can impact social, physical and, mental health [42], making this combined group relevant to study.

Given the lack of longitudinal data on voice problems in this study, it is not possible to conclude causality between chronic cough and voice problems. In a retrospective chart study on 105 patients with chronic cough and hoarseness, 86% reported voice problems after the diagnosis of chronic cough, suggesting a potential temporal relationship [46]. However, these results also do not establish causality, and further research is needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms and temporal patterns.

General health was assessed using a single, global question rather than using a full questionnaire. This approach, often used for assessing self-rated health, is comparable to multi-item health assessments [47]. Additionally, the number of sick leave days during the last year was based on self-reported data and not verified by any register data, potentially introducing recall bias.

The definitions of confounders such as asthma and nGER, based on self-reported questionnaire items, may be subject to misclassification due to recall bias or lack of clinical verification. Moreover, the questionnaire assessed nGER only, not reflux more broadly. However, these definitions have been used in several previous population-based studies and shown acceptable validity [32, 48].

Loss to follow-up from the initial RHINE cohort may have led to nonresponse bias. However, a previous study examining the implications of loss to follow-up in RHINE found minimal differences between long-term responders and baseline participants indicating that nonresponse bias is unlikely [30].

Conclusion

Voice problems are common among individuals with chronic cough in this North-European cohort, being most prevalent in individuals with productive cough. Long-term cough was more strongly associated with voice problems compared to shorter cough durations, especially in cases of dry cough. These findings highlight the importance of early management of chronic cough to prevent or alleviate the severity of voice problems. Both voice problems and chronic cough were associated with decreased general health and, when these conditions co-occur, their impact is additive. This emphasizes the importance for healthcare providers to identify and address both conditions at an early stage. Although chronic cough was found to increase sick leave, the same association was not found for voice problems.

Further longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the relationship between chronic cough and voice problems. Additionally, research focusing on the association between chronic cough, voice problems, and sick leave across various occupational groups is needed to identify at-risk populations. Moreover, interventional studies are needed to assess the effect of targeted treatment strategies for chronic cough and voice problems on quality of life, general health and sick-leave.

Abstract
Background

Indoor environmental factors, such as pet ownership, presence of cockroaches, mattress quality, fuel usage (gas or electricity), use of biomass for cooking and heating, exposure to tobacco smoke or household molds can significantly affect the sleep quality of children with chronic cough. However, data regarding the effects of indoor environmental conditions on sleep in this population are limited. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of abnormal sleep behaviors and to establish associations between indoor environmental factors and sleep behaviors among children with chronic cough in Wuxi, China.

Methods

A cross-sectional design was employed in this study, involving children aged 3–18 years. Data on sociodemographic factors, allergies, home environmental exposures, and sleep characteristics of the participants were collected using paper-based questionnaires. The association between indoor environmental factors and sleep behaviors in children with chronic cough was analyzed using logistic regression models.

Results

The findings demonstrated that the prevalence of chronic cough among children in Wuxi was 15.50%. The chronic cough group exhibited a significantly higher incidence of eczema, wheezing, rhinitis, food allergy, and nasosinusitis than the non-chronic cough group. In addition, children with chronic cough also tended to have a family history of sleep disorders and adenoid hypertrophy (P < 0.01). After adjusting for confounding factors, a significant association was observed between bruxism (teeth grinding) and chronic cough (sometimes: odds ratio [OR] = 1.04; confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.08; always: OR = 1.11; CI = 1.04–1.19; P < 0.01). Among children with chronic cough, recent home decoration was associated with sleepwalking (OR = 1.04; CI = 1.00–1.07; P < 0.05), mold exposure was associated with bruxism (OR = 1.15; CI = 1.0–1.31; P < 0.05), and carpet use at home was associated with apnea (OR = 1.09; CI = 1.02–1.17; P < 0.05), twitching during sleep (OR = 1.13; CI = 1.00–1.27; P < 0.01) and morning headache (OR = 1.14; CI = 1.05–1.23; P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Children with chronic cough are more prone to some abnormal sleep behaviors than children without chronic cough. Household decoration within a year, household mold exposure, and carpet use were all significantly positively associated with abnormal sleep behaviors in children with chronic cough. Our study provides novel insights into the impact of the indoor environment on children’s sleep and the occurrence of chronic cough, offering guidance for tailored health promotion programs for families.

Keywords: Chronic cough, Abnormal sleep behavior, Indoor environment, Children

Background

The Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Children with Cough in China (v2021) define chronic cough as persistent cough lasting > 4 weeks [1]. Unfortunately, many children with chronic cough and their families still make unnecessary medical visits, leading to significant financial and societal costs. In addition, chronic cough can cause various adverse effects, such as disrupting sleep quality, limiting participation in activities, causing emotional distress, and reducing overall quality of life [2]. The prevalence of chronic cough among children in China varies across different regions, with incidences ranging from 6 to 27% [3–5].

Quality sleep is crucial for a healthy childhood, but sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) can interfere with proper ventilation and breathing patterns during sleep, leading to a variety of physical and behavioral problems [6]. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD), 3rd edition, categorizes sleep disorders into seven groups: insomnia disorders, sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, parasomnias, and other sleep disorders [7]. Sleep breathing disorders are relatively common, with approximately one in ten healthy children habitually snoring during sleep. One in four children who snore have obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) [8]. Previous studies have explored the relationship between OSAS and chronic cough, reporting an association between chronic cough and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults. These studies suggested that treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure can alleviate cough symptoms [9]. However, there is no evidence to endorse the application of OSA-specific therapies for managing chronic cough in children [10]. Furthermore, many children without a clear diagnosis of OSAS are often assumed to have sleep-breathing disorders. This assumption arises because parents and guardians may not fully understand the medical terminology, and instead describe various abnormal sleep behaviors, including somnolence, insomnia, snoring, open-mouth breathing, dyspnea, apnea, sleep disturbance, teething disorder, sleep talking, sleepwalking, bedwetting, and hyperhidrosis. As such, the association between chronic cough and sleep disorders may have been underestimated.

In addition to the above, previous studies have highlighted the influence of indoor environments on childhood sleep. A systematic review exploring the relationships between air pollution exposure and sleep measures across different age groups revealed that children and adolescents exposed to higher environmental and indoor pollutants had a higher risk of experiencing respiratory sleep problems and other adverse sleep outcomes [11]. Moreover, studies have indicated that various indoor environmental factors, such as pet ownership, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke [12], exposure to household molds [13], the presence of cockroaches, mattress quality [14], fuel usage (gas or electricity) [15], and usage of biomass for cooking and heating [16], can increase the risk of persistent cough and intractable sputum in children. As such, it is reasonable to speculate that indoor environmental factors may significantly affect the sleep quality of children with chronic cough. However, data regarding the effects of indoor environmental conditions on sleep in this population are limited. Consequently, this research aimed to assess the prevalence of abnormal sleep behaviors and the associations between indoor environmental factors and sleep behaviors in children with chronic cough in Wuxi, China.

Methods
Setting, sampling, and participants

A cross-sectional design was employed in this study. Based on statistical calculations (), a sample size of 1,920 was determined, assuming a chronic cough prevalence of approximately 15% in children, a significance level of α = 0.05, a  value of 1.96, and an acceptable error of 0.1 p. Considering a 20% non-response rate, the sample size was fixed at 2,400. This study was conducted between October 2020 and April 2022 across five districts in Wuxi, Jiangsu, China. Schools and grade levels were randomly selected using computer-generated random numbers, considering the scale and distribution of schools in each region. Specifically, children aged 3–18 years were recruited as participants. School teachers distributed questionnaires to parents or guardians, and collected them after completion. The questionnaires were completed by the primary carers for children under 16 years old, and by both the primary carers and the children themselves for those aged 16–18 years. Before participant recruitment, approval for this study was obtained from the Affiliated Wuxi Children’s Hospital of Nanjing Medical University’s ethics committee (approval number WXCH2019-8-002).

Questionnaires
Demographic data/characteristics

Demographic data encompassed a variety of factors, including age, sex, weight (in kilograms), and height (in centimeters). Moreover, information was gathered regarding their history of asthma, sleep disturbances, exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy, and current smoking status within the family. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight (kg)/ height (m2), using values reported in the questionnaires.

Disease assessment

The definition of chronic cough used in this study aligned with the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Children with Cough in China [1], which has achieved consensus in the country. It was characterized by a positive response to the question, “Has your child ever experienced a cough lasting longer than 4 weeks in the last year?” An experienced physician re-confirmed the diagnosis of chronic cough after excluding the presence of respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia and bronchitis, during chronic cough by checking electronic or paper medical records. Another interesting aspect of this study was the assessment of allergic comorbidities based on self-reported information provided by guardians regarding physician-diagnosed conditions at any point in the child’s life. The definitions for various comorbidities were as follows. Eczema: Affirmative response to the query, “Has your child ever received a physician’s diagnosis of eczema?” Wheezing: Positive response to the question, “Has your child ever experienced whistling or wheezing in the chest at any time in the past?” Rhinitis: Confirmation of physician-diagnosed rhinitis or recurring symptoms of sneezing, blocked or runny nose not associated with a cold or flu. Food allergy: Validation of a clinician’s diagnosis of food allergy. Nasosinusitis: Physician-confirmed diagnosis of nasosinusitis. Urticaria: Physician-confirmed diagnosis of urticaria. Adenoid hypertrophy: Diagnosis of adenoid hypertrophy through nasopharyngeal lateral radiographs or electronic nasopharyngoscopy. Please refer to Additional file 1 for further details.

Home environmental exposure

The inquiries on home environmental exposure in this study were classified into three distinct groups: (1) Household renovation: These encompassed aspects such as recent decoration within a year, floor level, wall materials, floor materials, wall painting materials, furniture material, door material, pillow materials, and quilt materials. (2) Cooling method, heating method, and cooking fuel: This category focused on the specific techniques employed for cooling and heating, as well as the type of fuel used for cooking within the participants’ residences. (3) Household exposure to molds, pet ownership, presence of carpets, plants, and tobacco: This group of questions explored factors such as the presence of household molds, keeping of pets, utilization of carpets, presence of indoor plants, and exposure to tobacco smoke within the home environment. For further details, please refer to Additional file 1.

Pediatric sleep questionnaire

A retrospective parental report was used as the sleep questionnaire to assess sleep problems in children. The questionnaire evaluated various sleep behaviors and difficulties, including sleep gestures, duration, and abnormal sleep behaviors. Abnormal sleep behaviors encompassed several categories: (1) Night waking: waking during sleep and sleepwalking. (2) Parasomnias: This category encompassed twitching, bedwetting, restless sleep, sleep talking, bruxism (teeth grinding), and sweating. (3) Sleep-disordered breathing: Behaviors such as snorting, mouth opening, and dyspnea (difficulty breathing) fell under this category. (4) Daytime sleepiness: This included taking a long time to become alert, experiencing headaches, morning thirst, and napping. The participants’ parents were requested to indicate the frequency of their children’s sleep behaviors for each item over a typical recent week, using a three-point scale (never = 0 times/week; sometimes = 1–2 times/week; and always = 3–7 times/week). The Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), which served as the foundation for this questionnaire, was initially designed to screen problematic sleep behaviors in children aged 4–10 years [17], and was later validated for its applicability in toddlers and preschool-aged children, irrespective of their medical condition [18]. The CSHQ has been commonly applied in China, and has demonstrated acceptable internal consistency, reliability, and validity. The Cronbach’s α coefficient for the Chinese version of the full scale was 0.73, while the sub-scale coefficients ranged from 0.42 to 0.69 [19].

Statistical analysis

Statistical tests were conducted using the R program v3.6.2 (http://www.r-project.org/). Normally distributed data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation, whereas non-normally distributed data are expressed as the median and interquartile range. The t-test and Mann–Whitney U test were used for continuous variables. The Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test was employed for categorical variables. Logistic regression models were constructed to explore the association between each abnormal sleep behavior, chronic cough and indoor environmental factors. In order to reduce the confounding bias, the logistic regression models were adjusted for confounding factors (such as age, sex, BMI, former diseases, family history of asthma, etc.). Estimated odds ratios (eOR) and adjusted OR with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed to identify these associations. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results
Questionnaire and participant characteristics

In total, 2,310 parents/caregivers completed the questionnaires for this study. Some questionnaires were considered invalid due to incomplete data, duplicates, or false information, leaving 2,026 valid responses (response rate, 87.7%).

Overall, as shown in Tables 1 and 316 valid questionnaires were completed by the chronic cough group, whereas 1,710 were completed by children without chronic cough. The survey-weighted prevalence of children with chronic cough was 15.50% (n = 316). Overall, the average ages of chronic and non-chronic cough groups were 8.15 and 9.10 years (P < 0.01), respectively. However, there were no significant differences in terms of sex (56.60% vs. 51.90%, P = 0.14) or BMI (17.49 vs. 17.67, P = 0.59) between the chronic and non-chronic cough groups.

The chronic cough group exhibited significantly higher incidences of eczema (45.25% vs. 30.29%), wheezing (24.37% vs. 143%), rhinitis (42.09% vs. 24.32%), food allergy (12.66% vs. 6.90%) and nasosinusitis (8.87% vs. 4.67%) than controls. Children in the chronic cough group were also more likely to have a family history of sleep disorders (28.16% vs. 19.29%) and adenoid hypertrophy (7.91% vs. 3.92%) (P < 0.01) compared with the non-chronic cough group. The average sleep duration was 8.95 h for children with chronic cough, and 8.85 h for controls (P = 0.03).

No significant differences were detected between the two groups in terms of home environmental exposure variables, including floor type, household renovations (walls, furniture, doors, pillows, and quilt materials), use of air conditioners, fuel burning for cooking and heating, tobacco smoke exposure, carpet, flower, and pet exposure at home (Additional file 2). However, a higher percentage of children with chronic cough reported living in environments with a perception of moldy air compared with controls (21.2% vs. 15.1%; P < 0.001).

Table 2 presents the relationship between chronic cough and sleep behavior. In the unadjusted models, snoring (sometimes: OR = 1.05; CI = 1.02–1.08; P < 0.01; always: OR = 1.20; CI = 1.10–1.30; P < 0.001), restless sleep (sometimes: OR = 1.08; CI = 1.05–1.12; P < 0.001; always: OR = 1.13; CI = 1.05–1.22; P < 0.001), bruxism (sometimes: OR = 1.07; CI = 1.03–1.10; P < 0.001; always: OR = 1.15; CI = 1.07–1.23; P < 0.001), and sweating (sometimes: OR = 1.06; CI = 1.02–1.09; P < 0.01; always: OR = 1.16; CI = 1.10–1.22; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with a high risk of chronic cough. After adjusting for confounding factors, chronic cough was still significantly associated with bruxism (sometimes: OR = 1.04; CI = 1.01–1.08; always: OR = 1.11; CI = 1.04–1.19; P < 0.01). In the unadjusted analysis, a family history of sleep disturbance was significantly associated with the risk of chronic cough (OR = 1.07; CI = 1.03–1.11; P < 0.001). This significant difference was still detected even after adjusting for age and other covariates (OR = 1.05; CI = 1.01–1.09; P < 0.01). However, the adjusted analysis found no notable difference for the adenoid hypertrophy subset (OR = 1.02; CI = 0.95–1.10).

Associations between the indoor environment and abnormal sleep behavior among children with chronic cough

Logistic regression analysis conducted among children with chronic cough, before and after adjusting for confounders (Tables S3 and 4), identified several associations. Home decoration within a year was positively associated with sleepwalking (OR = 1.04; CI = 1.00–1.07; P < 0.05); mold exposure was positively associated with bruxism (OR = 1.15; CI = 1.0–1.31; P < 0.05); and carpet use at home was significantly positively associated with apnea (OR = 1.09; CI = 1.02–1.17; P < 0.05), twitching during sleep (OR = 1.13; CI = 1.00–1.27; P < 0.01), and morning headache (OR = 1.14; CI = 1.05–1.23; P < 0.01).

Discussion

This study was the first to investigate the prevalence of chronic cough among children aged 3–18 years in Wuxi, finding an overall incidence of 15.5%. Moreover, certain factors, such as household decoration within a year, household mold exposure, and carpet use, were identified as risk factors for abnormal sleep behaviors in children with chronic cough. Coughing serves as a defensive mechanism to prevent the intake of excessive fluids and foreign objects [20]; however, it can also significantly reduce quality of life and impose a substantial social and financial burden on society. In children, cough that persists for ≥ 4 weeks is classified as chronic [21, 22]. Chronic cough incurs an annual expenditure of approximately $360 million on over-the-counter drugs in the United States alone, with global costs exceeding $10 billion [23]. The economic burden of chronic cough has not been specifically investigated in China; however, we speculate that the situation is likely similar to that in the United States.

One meta-analysis conducted in 2022 indicated that the prevalence of chronic cough in southern cities was lower than that in northern cities [24], which suggests that regional factors and unique environmental and economic conditions may influence the prevalence of chronic cough. The higher prevalence observed in our study could be attributed to these factors. Wuxi, located in southern China, has experienced rapid industrialization, and has emerged as a major economic center in the Yangtze River Delta, with Shanghai at its core, since the 1980s. In 2022, Wuxi recorded a per capita GDP of RMB 199,015.7 billion, ranking third highest in Jiangsu province. Moreover, the city has undergone substantial urbanization, which could contribute to the increase in chronic cough diagnoses [25].

In our study, we observed that children with chronic cough were more likely to experience wheezing, eczema, rhinitis, or nasosinusitis than those in the control group, which aligns with previous studies [26, 27]. This increase may largely be attributed to shared underlying conditions such as airway hyper-responsiveness and atopy. A chart study focusing on children with sinusitis and chronic cough revealed that 65% of children with persistent cough displayed sinus abnormalities on radiography [28]. It is believed that nasal secretions, whether reaching the pharynx alone or in conjunction with the larynx, can stimulate nerve endings and trigger coughing [29]. The pathogenesis of chronic cough is complex and involves a variety of factors, including nasobronchial reflex, upper airway inflammation, exposure to cold and dry air, and the propagation of inflammatory mediators through the systemic circulation [30]. In addition, other etiological factors, such as central and peripheral neuroplasticity, may also contribute [31]. However, a definitive explanation has not yet been provided. Allergic diseases rarely occur in isolation, and must be considered alongside various comorbid conditions, including sinusitis, asthma, disrupted sleep, lymphoid hypertrophy causing obstructive sleep apnea, and subsequent behavioral effects [32].

Sleep is vital to children’s health and overall well-being. Previous research has confirmed that patients with chronic cough often complain of sleep disorders [33]. Moreover, another study found that the relationship between psychological distress and allergic disease is mediated by sleep disruption, highlighting the importance of assessing the sleep health of children with allergic conditions [34]. In the present study, sleep disturbances such as snoring, restless sleep, bruxism, and sweating were all found to besignificantly associated with a high risk of chronic cough, although some associations did not reach statistical significance. Most of these symptoms are consistent with the clinical presentation of OSA. Notably, multiple adult studies have demonstrated the association between OAS and chronic cough, with mechanisms including airway inflammatory responses, esophageal-tracheobronchial reflexes, airway wall edema, and sleep deprivation [35]. The muscular movements associated with coughing can lead to teeth grinding and arousal from sleep. Nocturnal hyperhidrosis can contribute to sympathetic nerves and acetylcholine neurotransmitters [36]. However, investigations into the association between chronic cough and sleep disorders in children are limited, and further investigations are require to assess if the underlying processes differ between children and adults.

Despite the well-documented impact of the indoor environment on children’s respiratory systems in numerous countries [37–39], only a few studies have examined the relationships between indoor environments and sleep disorders. Our study found that the use of carpets at home was associated with morning apnea, convulsions, and headaches in children with chronic cough. Carpets are known to be repositories of allergens, and considering that modern societies spend a significant amount of time indoors [40], it is crucial to examine their potential impact. Feline allergen I (feld I) [41], a common and significant feline allergen, has an 11-fold higher average concentration per unit area on carpeted floors than on other surfaces. This allergen can attach to surfaces, including fur, and tends to persist on carpets for extended periods. It can also bind to small dust particles (1–20 μm in size), enabling allergens to remain suspended in the air for longer durations [42]. A cross-sectional study conducted in four Swedish cities found a higher prevalence of snoring among individuals who reported humidity and air pollution in their homes [43]. However, in our study, no statistical significance was observed after adjustment. Tiesler et al. previously reported that visible mold or moisture in the home might have a negative impact on children’s sleep, although the specific sleep problems were not categorized. This study suggested an association between home moisture and bruxism [44]. Generally, indoor air pollutants, such as total volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, plasticizers, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10 etc.), and ultrafine particles, are significantly higher in bedrooms that have undergone home decoration or are exposed to smoke [45, 46]. Considering that decoration materials, indoor humidity, and smoking exposure are associated with allergic diseases [47], we hypothesized that indoor environments could negatively affect sleep through allergic inflammation. Nevertheless, further research is necessary to validate this finding and explore its underlying biological mechanisms.

This study identified the prevalence of chronic cough in Wuxi for the first time, and it concentrated on indoor environmental factors, which are relatively easy to modify among the variables which affect children’s life and health and have more guiding significance in the daily care of children by their guardians. The present study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the assessment of clinical symptoms relied on questionnaires completed by parents and guardians. This subjective reporting of whether children snore, experience difficulty breathing, grind their teeth, or experience night-time convulsions may introduce biases influenced by parental anxiety and lack of professional judgment, potentially impacting the reported prevalence of chronic cough and sleep disorders. As the variables required in our study were all provided by the children themselves and/or the primary caregivers, recall bias may have existed. However; we asked older children and their primary caregivers to complete the questionnaires together to minimize the risk of recall bias. Second, due to the study’s cross-sectional design, establishing causal relationships between variables was not possible. Finally, the influence of residual confounding factors cannot be entirely ruled out.

Conclusion

This study revealed a prevalence of 15.5% for chronic cough among children aged 3–18 years in Wuxi. Children with chronic cough are more prone to exhibiting some abnormal sleep behaviors than those without chronic cough. Household decoration within a year, household mold exposure, and carpet use were significantly positively associated with abnormal sleep behaviors in children with chronic cough. These results suggest that clinicians and parents should carefully consider these factors. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the impact of the indoor environment on children’s sleep and the occurrence of chronic cough, offering guidance for tailored health promotion programs for families.

Abstract

Chronic cough is a significant burden on patient quality of life and is associated with poor health outcomes. Chronic cough may be a result of neural hypersensitivity due to changes in both the peripheral and the central nervous systems, although the exact mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are not completely understood. Opioid receptors, specifically kappa and mu, are potential therapeutic targets in the management of chronic cough because they play a pivotal role in both the peripheral and the central neural pathways implicated in the act of coughing. Morphine, a mu opioid receptor agonist, is an effective cough modulator; however, mu receptor agonists are part of a drug class that can induce respiratory depression and euphoria, with strong reinforcing properties that may lead to excessive use and abuse. Drugs with a dual-acting mechanism of kappa receptor agonism and mu receptor antagonism may be effective in the management of chronic cough without the potential for abuse. This review summarizes the current understanding of the mechanisms of cough hypersensitivity, the role of the kappa and mu receptors in the neurophysiology of cough, and the clinical potential of targeting these receptors as a novel way of managing chronic cough.

Introduction

Chronic cough in adults is defined as a cough that lasts for 8 weeks or more [1, 2]. The prevalence of chronic cough is approximately 5–10% globally [3–5]. Chronic cough is most common among older patients (aged > 50 years) and is more prevalent in women than in men in the vast majority of studies [6, 7]. It is a comorbid condition that occurs in tandem with respiratory conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rhinosinusitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and other interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) [8–11]. Refractory chronic cough (RCC) is a cough that persists despite guideline-based treatment for the underlying disease, and unexplained chronic cough (UCC) is a chronic cough for which no cough-associated conditions are diagnosed [1]. Chronic cough may be a result of neural hypersensitivity [12] and, although the exact mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are not completely understood [4], it is suggested that changes in both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the central nervous system (CNS) are involved [12].

The substantial burden of chronic cough has a significant impact on work productivity, interpersonal relationships, and healthcare resources [4], and, because of this, patients commonly consult with primary care physicians [9]. The impact of chronic cough on daily quality of life is considerable, and the impact is estimated to be similar to that of respiratory lung disease, such as asthma, bronchiectasis, and COPD [13]. In IPF specifically, chronic cough is associated with disease progression and poor health outcomes [11, 14, 15].

Many treatments are used to manage chronic cough, such as neuromodulators, including low-dose morphine, gabapentin, and pregabalin, or non-pharmacological approaches, such as speech therapy or physiotherapy [1]. However, chronic cough is often refractory to treatment and there is a need for better therapies. Recently, the P2X3 antagonist gefapixant was approved for use in managing RCC and UCC in many countries, including those in the European Union, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and Japan; it is not approved in the United States [16–19]. We summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms of cough hypersensitivity and the potential of novel dual-acting agonist–antagonist opioid receptor-targeting drugs for management of chronic cough.

Overview of the Mechanisms of Chronic Cough and Cough Hypersensitivity

Cough is characterized by a forced expulsive maneuver, usually against a closed glottis, and is accompanied by a characteristic sound [20]. Under normal conditions, cough provides a crucial protective function of the lungs, preventing aspiration [21]. Cough involves a neural pathway in which sensory nerves in the airways are activated, leading to an alteration in the respiratory pattern via complex circuitry in the CNS. Three types of cough have been classified on the basis of their central control mechanisms: type I (reflex cough), type II (voluntary cough), and type III (evoked cough) [22].

The primary distinction between evoked and reflex cough depends on the intensity of the stimulus [22]. Coughing typically happens when an irritating stimulus is detected, triggering a sensation known as the urge to cough [23]. This sensation involves the activation of several brain regions: the primary sensory and motor cortex, the insula, the orbitofrontal cortex, discrete areas of the anterior cingulate cortex, and the cerebellum [23]. Weak stimuli (such as strong odors, e.g., perfume, or a tickling sensation in the throat) lead to an urge to cough sensation followed by an evoked cough, while strong stimuli induce reflex cough via brainstem circuitry [22]. Evoked cough engages medullary and supramedullary CNS structures in a mechanistic interplay [22]. Often, patients can consciously suppress evoked cough [21, 22]; however, reflex cough becomes inevitable as the intensity of the stimulus increases [22]. Reflex cough engages the afferent nerves in the pulmonary tissue, sending signals to the sensory and respiratory nuclei of the brainstem. These afferent nerve fiber inputs result in the activation of the efferent nerve fibers responsible for the coordinated neuromuscular act of coughing through their innervation of thoracic structures [4, 21, 22]. Examples of reflex cough are aspiration of a foreign body into the airway or experimentally induced cough with high concentrations of inhaled tussive agents such as capsaicin [22]. In contrast with reflex cough, voluntary cough involves supramedullary CNS structures and is initiated consciously, independent of external stimuli [22]. Functional magnetic resonance imaging in patients with evoked or voluntary cough shows activation in multiple areas, expressing opioid receptors such as the kappa opioid receptors (KORs) and the mu opioid receptors (MORs), within the mid-cingulate cortex, insula, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem [22, 24].

Chronic cough occurs in patients who have pulmonary conditions that affect the airway, such as IPF, asthma, and rhinosinusitis, and other conditions such as extra-esophageal reflux disease or airway reflux [9–11, 21, 25]. It is suggested in the evolving hypothesis that local tissue inflammation-induced effects contribute to chronic cough and that chronic cough is associated with altered neurophysiology [9, 12]. The disparate chronic cough-related patient populations are collectively recognized under the clinical concept of cough hypersensitivity syndrome (CHS) [9]. The sensorimotor phenomenology of cough suggests that CHS is attributed to increased sensitivity of the peripheral vagus nerve or an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory function of the CNS [4, 9].

Neurophysiology in Chronic Cough

The neurophysiological concept of sensitization may explain the development of chronic cough. Sensitization refers to the phenomena of increased responsiveness of peripheral and central nociceptive neural pathways to their normal or subthreshold afferent input [9, 26]. Therefore, the concept of sensitization could provide insight into CHS, in which coughing is more readily activated with subnormal sensitivity thresholds [4]. The idea of sensitization encompasses multiple neurophysiological mechanisms that separately or collectively may be relevant to addressing the underlying cause of chronic cough. Understanding these mechanisms supports the development of drugs designed to target opioid receptors, which are densely populated in the regions of the CNS and PNS that regulate sensitization [22, 24]. Much of what is understood about the development of sensory hypersensitivity states comes from studies of chronic pain and chronic itch in which common mechanisms have been identified: namely, peripheral sensitization, wind-up, and central sensitization [27, 28].

Peripheral sensitization commonly occurs in afferent sensory receptors under conditions of local tissue damage that alters the biology of afferent nerve ending–local tissue homeostasis [29]. These peripheral nerves are responsible for the transmission of information arising from tissue damage to the CNS and include A-delta fibers and C-fibers [30, 31], which, among other receptors, express the KORs and MORs on their nerve endings [32, 33]. In peripheral sensitization, the afferent nerve fibers become more excitable, making other triggering stimuli more likely to cause afferent nerve activation [34], thereby increasing the sensory drive to evoke coughing.

In contrast, the process of central sensitization involves mechanisms in the CNS that amplify sensory nerve fiber inputs, such that even normal afferent nerve fiber activity can produce heightened cough responses [9, 27]. The mechanisms leading to central sensitization have been studied extensively in spinal pain circuits, where it has been suggested that it is promoted through the activation of neurokinin receptors, leading to a gradual depolarization that alleviates the magnesium ion (Mg2+) block on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors expressed by spinal dorsal horn neurons [27]. In addition, dorsal horn inflammation is believed to be important in maintaining centrally sensitized states, through a process orchestrated by spinal glial cells [27]. The evidence supporting a role for central sensitization in chronic cough is growing [9]. Notably, and consistent with prior chronic pain studies in human and animal models, patients with chronic cough show central sensitization effects associated with reduced excitability thresholds in brain structures that extend from the upper brainstem to the cortex [9, 27].

The Role of KOR and MOR in Chronic Cough

Opioid receptors are a family of homologous cell surface, G-protein-coupled receptors [31, 35] and are expressed throughout the CNS and the PNS [35]. The three most well-studied opioid receptors are KOR, MOR, and delta opioid receptor (DOR) [35]. Opioid receptors trigger activation of adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and, thus, elicit stimulatory or inhibitory actions. The elevated cAMP levels can activate protein kinase A, which causes phosphorylation of various proteins, ion channels, and enzymes, subsequently leading to their activation or inhibition [36]. There are more than 20 endogenous opioids, each with unique selectivity and signaling across the different opioid receptors [37]. Primarily, dynorphins, endorphins, and enkephalins are the endogenous opioids for KOR, MOR, and DOR, respectively [38]. However, the endogenous opioids do not exhibit exclusive activity via the respective opioid receptor [38]. The diversity of the opioid receptors and endogenous opioids may exist to facilitate the precise fine-tuning of physiological responses [37].

Opioid Receptor Expression

The KORs and MORs are crucial to regulating affective states, neuroendocrine and autonomic stress responses, and mood and motivational states [39]. These receptors are widely expressed throughout the CNS, the respiratory system, and the PNS [24, 39]. Peripherally, the most abundant sites of opioid receptor expression are within the structures central to the regulation of bronchial and pulmonary vascular responses, including the vagus nerve [40, 41]. Opioid receptors are also located in the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and sensory C-fibers within the bronchial epithelium [33] and in the peripheral endings of A-delta fibers and C-fibers, which innervate the thoracic structures [32–34]. Centrally, MORs are highly expressed in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, amygdala, brainstem, and spinal cord [32]. With respect to the respiratory system, these structures all contribute to the control of pulmonary ventilation mechanics, respiratory reflexes, and the perception of respiratory sensations [9]. A high density of KORs exists in the frontal cortex, insula, and amygdala [42]. Multiple endogenous opioids with different relative affinities for opioid receptor subtypes are found in the medullary and pontine respiratory regions, and all three classic opioid receptors are found in the respiratory-related regions of the brainstem and spinal cord [43] (Fig. 1).

The peripheral and central processes contributing to cough

KORs and MORs as Therapeutic Targets in Chronic Cough

The neurobiological pathways responsible for hypersensitivity in chronic cough, pain, and itch overlap [28, 44]. Given the role and expression of KORs and MORs in the CNS and the PNS, it is not surprising that results of preclinical studies have shown that KOR and MOR agonists and antagonists can modulate the sensitivity of peripheral vagal afferent nerves [45–47]. This influence may extend to other peripheral processes, such as regulation of cholinergic neurotransmission in the airway, ultimately impacting airway tone [46]; thus, the rationale for investigating opioid receptor-directed pharmacological interventions is clear. This drug class has the potential to modulate both the threshold set point in the transition from evoked cough to reflex cough and the pathological effects of central sensitization. Results from preclinical studies have shown that KORs and MORs mediate the anti-tussive effects of codeine, supporting their role as important therapeutic targets for chronic cough [48–50]. Other study results have shown that KORs are involved in the modulation of inflammation [51, 52], including inflammatory processes in the lungs [53], possibly by reducing the inflammatory response of alveolar macrophages [54].

Morphine is a MOR agonist that also exhibits partial agonistic activity on KORs [55–57]. MOR agonists belong to a class of drug known to induce respiratory depression and euphoria and to possess strong reinforcing properties, potentially leading to excessive use and abuse [39, 58]. Administering MOR agonists and mixed MOR/KOR and MOR/DOR agonists in animal models increased extracellular dopamine levels in the shell of the nucleus accumbens; it is suggested that this increase contributes to the development of the reinforcing properties of many drugs of abuse in humans [59–62]. Low-dose morphine is used in the management of chronic cough and is recommended in current guidelines [1, 57]. Because there is a lack of a dose–response relationship with morphine as an anti-tussive agent, higher doses of morphine such as those used in pain management are not recommended for the management of chronic cough [1].

Treatment with slow-release morphine (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) is well tolerated, with minimal sedation effects in patients with refractory chronic cough [57]. In patients who responded to low-dose morphine sulfate, cough frequency was reduced by 71.8% compared with placebo over a 24-h period [56]. In another study [63], patients with chronic cough due to IPF reported a 39.4% reduction in cough frequency after 14 days of twice daily treatment with low-dose morphine compared with placebo. Common side effects reported in these studies included nausea, constipation, and drowsiness [48, 57, 63]. The major drawback of the clinical use of morphine is the risk of physical dependence [48]. Morphine for pain management has contributed to a worldwide epidemic of opioid abuse, where prescriptions for MOR agonists often serve as a pathway to illicit drug use [39]. Other opioid receptor agonists have shown anti-tussive effects. For example, although both classified as Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act in the United States, pentazocine [64] and butorphanol [65], administered intravenously, were effective in managing the adverse effect of acute cough during anesthesia induction [66, 67]. Butorphanol has been approved as an anti-tussive agent for use in veterinary medicine [68].

Although codeine, a pro-drug of morphine, is often regarded as the “gold standard” for the management of cough, evidence from several studies shows a lack of effective cough suppression compared with placebo [69–71]. In one study [72], only ~ 17% of patients with chronic cough responded to codeine as a treatment for cough suppression. Codeine is 3-methylmorphine and undergoes de-methylation in the liver with a genetically variable first-pass metabolism with poor therapeutic response in some patients, likely due to variable metabolism [73]. Like morphine, codeine is also associated with the risk of abuse and, as a result, was recently re-classified as a prescription-only medicine in the United Kingdom [74]. Therapies that target KORs have also been studied to manage pain, depression, and anxiety [35]. Mixed opioid agonists or peripherally restricted KOR agonists have been effective in blocking the rewarding effects of morphine; therefore, they have therapeutic potential in managing drug abuse [35]. When administered subcutaneously in dogs, the anti-tussive effect of butorphanol was 4 times more potent than morphine and 100 times more potent than codeine; when administered orally, it was approximately 15–20 times more active than either codeine or dextromethorphan [75].

Given the neuroanatomical location of the KORs and MORs and the reported clinical trial results, mixed opioids as a drug class may target both the central and the peripheral neural pathways and could address a gap in the management of chronic cough. The mechanistic potential for synergistic pharmacological action in KORs and MORs, both centrally and peripherally in lung tissue, is promising for achieving clinically meaningful efficacy. This is in contrast with ongoing therapies aimed at addressing cough that primarily target a single opioid receptor, such as morphine, or those that target other receptors, such as P2X3 found on peripheral nerve endings [76]. Specifically, a therapy that targets both KORs and MORs could lead to synergistic anti-tussive effects without the potential for abuse. Opioid agonist–antagonist drugs that exhibit dual pharmacological actions by acting as agonists at KORs and antagonists at MORs were developed in a deliberate effort to create effective analgesic agents with less potential for abuse [77]. In support of this pharmacological approach, the parenterally administered opioid agonist–antagonist nalbuphine has demonstrated in a clinical study preventative anti-tussive effects for the management of acute cough during administration of sufentanil-induced anesthesia [78]. Furthermore, pentazocine and butorphanol have been effective as pre-treatments for fentanyl-induced cough in the perioperative setting [66, 79].

A Novel Therapeutic Agent for Chronic Cough

The agonist–antagonist opioid moiety nalbuphine provides an additional synergistic possibility by acting simultaneously at the KORs and MORs. In its approved parenteral formulation, nalbuphine is not considered a controlled substance in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act [80]. In addition, at the international level, nalbuphine is not included in the List of Narcotic Drugs Under International Control [81]. Nalbuphine, approved in the parenteral formulation for the treatment of severe pain [82], is currently being investigated as an oral formulation for the management of chronic cough [83]. In a recent phase 2 clinical study of patients with chronic IPF-related cough, the use of nalbuphine extended-release (ER) tablets demonstrated a significant reduction in the frequency of IPF-associated cough. This short-term crossover trial consisted of two 22-day treatment periods, with participants with definite or probable IPF [83]. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive nalbuphine ER (27 mg once daily titrated to 162 mg twice daily) during period 1 followed by a crossover to placebo during period 2, or placebo during period 1 followed by nalbuphine ER during period 2. After the two 22-day treatment periods, the use of nalbuphine ER had significantly reduced the frequency of daytime cough, assessed objectively, by 75.1%, compared with 22.6% with placebo (p < 0.001) [83]. Furthermore, a 76.1% reduction (95% CI 83.1–69.1) was observed in the 24-h objective cough frequency with nalbuphine ER, compared with a 25.3% decrease (95% CI 43.9–6.7) with placebo [83]. Nalbuphine ER may have an advantage because it was designed to act synergistically both centrally in the brain and the brainstem and peripherally in the lungs to provide an anti-tussive effect independent of peripheral cough stimuli. A centrally acting agent may be effective across a broader spectrum of chronic cough phenotypes because the response is not dependent on a specific trigger.

Conclusions

The substantial unmet need for an effective and well-tolerated treatment for chronic cough is challenging. The neurophysiological concept of sensitization, an important phenomenon in the field of pain, may be both an explanation for the development of chronic cough and point to opioid receptor-targeted therapy as an intervention. Opioid receptors have shown unique properties by which cough can be modulated. KORs and MORs are important therapeutic targets for cough suppression in CHS. Dual-effect opioids that have KOR agonism and MOR antagonism have unique properties across chronic sensory disorders and, thus, may reduce cough, with low sedation and low potential for drug abuse. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the role of opioid receptors in the central and peripheral pathways of cough hypersensitivity and the role of mixed-effect opioids in managing chronic cough.
