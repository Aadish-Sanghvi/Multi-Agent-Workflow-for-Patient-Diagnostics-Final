    "17-year-old male (52 kg, O+) presents with 4 days of URI symptoms (sore throat, rhinorrhea improving) and productive cough; noted scant hemoptysis today (~1 teaspoon total, bright red streaks, no clots), low-grade fever 37.8\u00b0C, mild exertional dyspnea, dull cough-associated non-pleuritic chest pain. No weight loss, night sweats, epistaxis, gum bleeding, easy bruising. Non-smoker, no vaping, no known TB contacts; classmate with cough last week; no recent travel. Medications tried: paracetamol 500 mg x2, OTC dextromethorphan x2. Provisional diagnosis: Acute bronchitis/upper respiratory infection with scant hemoptysis from airway irritation; pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis lower-likelihood but to be excluded with imaging and persistence criteria. Differential: acute bronchitis/viral URI; bacterial pneumonia (consider if fever escalates or focal findings); pulmonary tuberculosis (rule out if persistent or abnormal CXR); posterior epistaxis mimicking hemoptysis; less likely bronchiectasis/foreign body/coagulopathy. Recommended investigations: Chest X-ray (PA/LAT) now; CBC with platelets; consider PT/INR/aPTT if bleeding disorder suspected; sputum studies if purulent sputum and fever persist; TB workup (AFB/NAAT, IGRA/TST) if CXR abnormal or symptoms persist. Initial management: Supportive care (hydration, rest, humidified air), cautious antitussive use, avoid NSAIDs; no routine antibiotics unless pneumonia suspected clinically or on CXR. Safety-net: escalate for large-volume hemoptysis, worsening dyspnea, hypoxia, high fever, syncope, chest pain at rest, instability. Follow-up: 48\u201372 hours to review CXR/labs; if hemoptysis persists >1 week or recurs, consider contrast-enhanced chest CT and pulmonology/ENT evaluation.",

    "17-year-old male (52 kg, O+) presents with 4 days of URI symptoms (sore throat, rhinorrhea improving) and productive cough; noted scant hemoptysis today (~1 teaspoon total, bright red streaks, no clots), low-grade fever 37.8\u00b0C, mild exertional dyspnea, dull cough-associated non-pleuritic chest pain. No weight loss, night sweats, epistaxis, gum bleeding, easy bruising. Non-smoker, no vaping, no known TB contacts; classmate with cough last week; no recent travel. Medications tried: paracetamol 500 mg x2, OTC dextromethorphan x2. Provisional diagnosis: Acute bronchitis/upper respiratory infection with scant hemoptysis from airway irritation; pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis lower-likelihood but to be excluded with imaging and persistence criteria. Differential: acute bronchitis/viral URI; bacterial pneumonia (consider if fever escalates or focal findings); pulmonary tuberculosis (rule out if persistent or abnormal CXR); posterior epistaxis mimicking hemoptysis; less likely bronchiectasis/foreign body/coagulopathy. Recommended investigations: Chest X-ray (PA/LAT) now; CBC with platelets; consider PT/INR/aPTT if bleeding disorder suspected; sputum studies if purulent sputum and fever persist; TB workup (AFB/NAAT, IGRA/TST) if CXR abnormal or symptoms persist. Initial management: Supportive care (hydration, rest, humidified air), cautious antitussive use, avoid NSAIDs; no routine antibiotics unless pneumonia suspected clinically or on CXR. Safety-net: escalate for large-volume hemoptysis, worsening dyspnea, hypoxia, high fever, syncope, chest pain at rest, instability. Follow-up: 48\u201372 hours to review CXR/labs; if hemoptysis persists >1 week or recurs, consider contrast-enhanced chest CT and pulmonology/ENT evaluation.",
    "28-year-old female presents with 3 weeks of episodic wheeze, chest tightness, and nocturnal cough, worse with exercise and dust exposure; partial relief with friend\u2019s salbutamol inhaler. No fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis. Past history notable for childhood atopy (eczema); non-smoker. Exam between episodes is normal; peak flow variable at home (350\u2013420 L/min). Provisional diagnosis: Asthma (mild persistent). Differential: exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, allergic rhinitis with post-nasal drip, GERD-related cough. Recommended investigations: Spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility; consider FeNO and allergy testing. Initial management: Inhaled low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA; trigger avoidance and spacer technique education; action plan with peak-flow zones. Follow-up: 2\u20134 weeks to assess control and adherence; step-up if persistent symptoms.",
    "6-month-old male with 2 days of cough, rhinorrhea, poor feeding, and increasing work of breathing; exam shows tachypnea, subcostal retractions, nasal flaring, diffuse crackles and wheeze; SpO2 90% on room air. No prior wheeze episodes. Provisional diagnosis: Acute bronchiolitis (likely RSV). Differential: viral pneumonia, early asthma phenotype (less likely at this age), bacterial pneumonia (if focal consolidation). Recommended investigations: Pulse oximetry; CXR only if severe/atypical; viral testing if needed for cohorting. Initial management: Oxygen to maintain SpO2 \u2265 92%, nasal suctioning, hydration support; avoid routine bronchodilators/steroids unless trial beneficial. Escalation: Worsening hypoxia, apnea, exhaustion, dehydration. Follow-up: Inpatient observation if oxygen requirement persists; otherwise close outpatient follow-up within 24\u201348 hours.",
    "64-year-old male with 3 months of exertional chest pressure (5\u201310 min, relieved by rest), associated with dyspnea; risk factors include hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and 30-pack-year smoking history (quit 5 years ago). No rest pain or syncope. Exam unremarkable; resting ECG normal. Provisional diagnosis: Stable angina (chronic coronary syndrome). Differential: GERD, musculoskeletal chest pain, anxiety/panic, microvascular angina. Recommended investigations: Stress test (exercise ECG or imaging), lipid panel, A1c; consider coronary CT angiography if intermediate risk. Initial management: Antiplatelet (aspirin unless contraindicated), statin (high-intensity), sublingual nitroglycerin PRN; optimize BP, glycemic control, lifestyle.
