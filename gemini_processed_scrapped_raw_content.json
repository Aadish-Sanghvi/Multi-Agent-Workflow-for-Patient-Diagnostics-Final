    "content": "Chronic cough is defined as a cough that lasts for 8 weeks or more and can significantly impact quality of life. It may result from neural hypersensitivity due to changes in the peripheral and central nervous systems.\n\nSeveral treatments are used to manage chronic cough, including neuromodulators like low-dose morphine, gabapentin, and pregabalin, as well as non-pharmacological approaches like speech therapy or physiotherapy. However, chronic cough is often refractory to treatment.\n\nOpioid receptors, specifically kappa (KOR) and mu (MOR), are potential therapeutic targets. Morphine, a MOR agonist, is an effective cough modulator, but it can induce respiratory depression and euphoria, potentially leading to abuse. Drugs with a dual-acting mechanism of KOR agonism and MOR antagonism may be effective without the potential for abuse.\n\nNalbuphine, an opioid agonist-antagonist, is being investigated as an oral formulation for chronic cough. In a phase 2 clinical study, nalbuphine extended-release tablets significantly reduced daytime cough frequency in patients with chronic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-related cough.\n\nIf you have chronic cough, consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. They may consider various factors and recommend suitable therapies, including medications or non-pharmacological approaches."

    "content": "East Asian Traditional Medicine (EATM) for Chronic Cough:\n\nIf you have a chronic cough that persists despite conventional treatments, East Asian traditional medicine (EATM) which includes herbal medicine and/or acupuncture, might be an option to consider.\n\nKey Points from Research:\n\n*   EATM Use: Frequently used when conventional treatments don't fully resolve chronic cough.\n*   Study Focus: A review of studies on EATM treatments (herbal medicine, acupuncture, etc.) for chronic cough, regardless of the cause.\n*   Study Types: Most studies were randomized controlled trials with both children and adults.\n*   Causes of Cough: In studies that reported the cause of cough, common causes were upper airway cough syndrome and post-respiratory infection.\n*   Treatment Duration: EATM treatments were typically conducted for about 19 days.\n*   Herbal Medicine: Herbal medicine was the most common EATM treatment.\n*   Control Groups: Conventional medications were often used as a comparison in studies.\n*   Outcomes: Most studies reported positive outcomes with EATM treatments, often measured by the total effective rate and cough severity.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   Specify Cause: Future studies should specify the cause of chronic cough or indicate if the study targets nonspecific chronic cough.\n*   High-Quality Studies: More high-quality studies with placebo controls are needed to assess the efficacy of EATM using validated evaluation tools.\n\nConventional Treatment Limitations:\n\n*   Conventional treatments may not always be effective, with a significant percentage of patients not responding adequately.\n\nEATM as an Alternative:\n\n*   EATM may be an effective alternative when the cause of cough is unclear or resistant to conventional treatments.\n\nTypes of EATM Treatments:\n\n*   Herbal medicine, acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping therapy, and other related therapies.\n\nStandardized Assessment:\n\n*   Future studies should use standardized and objective evaluation tools to assess the effect of EATM treatment."
